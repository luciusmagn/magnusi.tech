Alright, that should do it. Ella wiped sweat from her forehead and threw
the wrench on the ground.

Now, she just needs to verify, if it works. How about I put this apple into
it, she thought. Suddenly, the same apple appeared on the counter. Looks like it works,
then. She took the apple, put it into the machine and set the timer to minus 20 seconds.
The apple disappeared.

This was enough testing for Ella. She has done her science and her research and
she seems to have a pretty good understanding of the time-space continuum.

There is this matter called time fabric, which is inseparably interwoven with space,
and if one manages to get into it, they can travel back and forth in time within this
given reality. The time fabric exists, for lack of a better term, perpendicular to
the space we see in the universe, and together, they make spacetime. This perpendicularity
is actually the time fabric being positioned along the direction of the flow of time.

Since space and time are intertwined, things in space can affect the time continuum as
well. Many years ago, this was first observed when we found discrepancies between
time near heavy objects and far away from them. This is called time dilation.
When objects are heavy enough, their gravitational pull can pull on the time fabric
as well, slowing down its flow. Similar effects can be observed for objects that
move very fast.

Ella discovered a glitch in the system, a way that allows to disturb localized space
in such a way that the time fabric is exposed and a rift in space is created, which
allows movement across the time stream in both directions. However, this does not come
for free. Time has to maintain its integrity. Therefore, time is added to objects moving
forward, and time is deducted from objects moving back in time.

In essence, the apple Ella sent back was twenty seconds younger when it arrived twenty
seconds into the past. This would mean that when Ella travels back in time, she will be
a child again. It appears that sacrifices can be made and time of one thing can be sacrificed
more so than time of another thing, but the total sum of time added and deducted must be zero.

It is a similar principle to how the amount of energy in the universe never changes,
and even though it may slightly change due to quantum fluctuations, in which virtual
particles briefly become tangible, the total sum of energy in the universe has to be the
same. However, no one says that a virtual particle cannot steal a real particles energy
and ensure that it will be the real particle that disappears and becomes virtual. This
is a similar principle.

Through her previous experiments, Ella discovered that opening any sort of rift leaked
a strange clear, slightly viscous liquid. For lack of a better term, we can refer to
this as the time liquid, or the time fabric liquid, but the shorter term sounds better.

Now, the time liquid, despite clearly interacting with its environment in a manner similar
to matter more commonly found in the universe, was comprised of strange particles, not yet
known to science. By careful examination, Ella discovered that this liquid has strange
properties. Everything covered with and saturated with the liquid is exempt from the
time addition and time deduction laws. However, the zero-sum law still stands, so objects
completely saturated with it are not able to enter the time stream, if they are not
accompanied by another sacrificial object. The time deducted or added to the sacrificial
object will be proportional to the ratio between the mass of the sacrificial and the
exempt object.

Ella decided to use this to her advantage. Through the use of one very gruesome-looking surgery,
she made several incisions to her spine and skull and saturated her cerebrospinal fluid
with the time liquid. This would ensure that she keeps her mind, memories and mental
faculties in the state they are at time of departure. Luckily, the time fluid is not
poisonous, it seems.

Next, she planned to take a backpack of a random assortment of old, durable objects,
which would make sure that the sum total of time deducted to her body will make the
rest of her body be the exact age she had at the time of her arrival and not younger.

Now, it was time for her to confirm her calculations at a smaller scale. She had a small
tree and a pretty large block of sandstone. She was saturating the sandstone with time fluid
for several days now and, after weighing it now and deducting the original weight before
the procedure, she concluded that it is fully saturated. She then printed a QR code with
a UNIX timestamp encoded into it and stuck it to the stone block and covered it with the
time liquid as well.

She then put both the tree and the block into the machine and sent it back to a specified
place in space and time. It was an old shed on the other side of the city she was in right
now and she hasn't visited it on purpose for quite some time. Inside, she set up a camera
with a motion sensor and set it to automatically send the picture to her computer at the time
defined by the QR code the camera reads. She printed a code with a timestamp of three minutes
from now.

The wait was nerve-racking. She was very nervous and she kept tapping the counter in her
workshop with her fingers. She was thinking about her sister Neiro and how she was doing
all of this for her. She could hear the clock in the workshop ticking.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

It was the only sound she focused on for the next three minutes. Suddenly, her computer
let out a ding sound and she immediately leapt over to it and opened the message. Success,
inside saw a photo of the sandstone block wit the QR code sticker on it, and next to it,
the tree. The tree had devolved into a seedling, just as it should have. She pulled out
an older photo from her camera which she took when this tree was just a seedling two months
ago. It looks identical. Perfect.

Phew. Ella now took off all her clothes, earrings and everything that wasn't biological
that she could remove. She took some chemicals and thoroughly washed everything of off her.
She already took laxatives some time prior and now did her best to empty both her bowel
and bladder. She then stuck a spatula down her throat and vomited until she no longer could,
getting rid of the entirety of her stomach content. This felt sick but it was necessary
to ensure the calculations were correct.

She then weighted herself. She was off by about -70 grams from her expected weight. That would
have an impact of a few days on her age, but Ella wanted to be precise. So she went over to
her backpack and pulled out a bag of marbles and started taking them out and weighing them.
Fuck, 15 marbles were 68 grams and 16 marbles were 73. So she took a hammer and started carefully
hitting one of the marbles until it cracked into several small pieces. She then started weighing
the pieces until she was at 71, the she took the biggest piece and started sanding it down
and weighing it, until the total was 70 grams. Perfect.

She then took on the clothes she had prepared. They were about fifteen years old these clothes,
judging by the tags that were sewn onto them, so they were "time proof" and more era appropriate
than her regular clothes. They were also a little small for Ella, but she was smaller back then.
She knew that these clothes would still be big in the past, but at least they would be more manageable
than her regular attire. Of course, the clothes were perfectly cleaned and weighted as to not disturb
the equilibrium.

She put on these clothes. No underwear unfortunately, she couldn't find one that would be this old
and trustworthy/unstained permanently. The T-shirt was a little uncomfortable for her bare breasts,
but luckily her breasts weren't really born yet at the time she was traveling to. Her nether regions
will have to manage as well. She did her best to clean the trousers, so hopefully she won't get an
infection.

Alright, put on the backpack and preparations are finished. Ella went over to the machine and set
the dial to the specific time period and set a timer to twenty seconds. She then stepped into
the machine and waited. Right before the timer ran out and the machine started working, she
took a deep breath - she had no idea if there would be breathable air in the time stream.

.

.

.

Ella is flying through (or she was launched into, more accurately) what appears to be like a very large
tunnel, at least a hundred meters in diameter. The walls of the tunnel seem to be a liquid, possibly time
liquid and shone with light with hints of green and blue. Like a very green sea, saturated with algae.

Her flight is in an arc, what the machine is, in terms of likening it to something more commonly known,
essentially a cannon, it launches you in a specific direction across the time stream with an appropriate
force so that you will land and fall out of the time fabric in the correct time and place. Ella realized
that it could be used to implement a form of teleportation as well, where the time stream would be used to
travel to a different place at the same time, but that was not her intention for her mission.

Her arc is reaching its peak and she is quickly losing vertical velocity. This means that she is nearing
half her journey. Her mind seemed to be completely intact, as far as she could tell, which means that
her nervous system protection is working as it should.

Suddenly, a small fishing hook latches onto her. It got caught on her backpack and buried itself deep into
it. She is suddenly being pulled up by a strong force and into the roof of the time stream tunnel.

She flies at full speed through the top of the tunnel and even a few feet upwards into the place where
she is now? Where she is now? Hard to tell.

It is a strange landscape. It is like the surface of a vast, perhaps infinite body of water, there are almost
no waves, especially not around the man who pulled Ella out of the time-stream. This is not the normal world
or dimension, Ella could feel that.

The man looks quite old. His hair and beard are completely gray, with hints of pure white, but his eyes are
very clear and have a light blue color. Lighter than what is commonly seen in man.

He is wearing a simple, if not antiquated, outfit made from loose leather. Along with that, he wears a darker leather hat,
one common for fishermen and whalers of old.

He has a long stick stuck in the water next to him, as if it were plunged into and embedded into the ground,
not in a liquid. At the top, there is a few order leaves. Interestingly, the stick looks younger and greener
at the bottom than at the top. The top part is stern and matured, whereas the base of the branch appears to be green, young,
and malleable.

He is standing on surface on the water. Around him the water is completely still. He nonchalantly keeps reeling
in the fishing line and dragging Ella towards him across the surface of the water. Since there is very little
friction, this is not a hard thing to do.

Ella is comes to her senses and asks: "What the hell is this!?"
She tears off the fishing hook from the backpack and throws it into the water. The old man calmly reels
it in.

He has a peaceful, friendly expression on his face. And yet, there is a hint of loneliness in his eyes. And purity.

"Greetings, child. I have pulled you out of the ocean before bad things happen. I am Xexanoth, the antithesis of
Aforgomon, the god of time. I govern the direction of time going backwards."

"What the hell?!" Ella's question was still the same.

"Oh, child, I pulled you out of the water because your existence would be that of an unchecked paradox. I know
everything there is to know about time. I have seen the futures for what you are doing, Ella. Regardless of whether
or not you succeed in your quest, you will destroy the reality you come from. You come from that reality, so you
would destroy yourself. And if you would do that, you will create a paradox."

"No... but I have to... my sister..." Ella was visibly affected by this revelation.

"It is like a river. You change the flow of the river and it will flow through different lands.
A place that might have been originally sprouting with vegetation may now be a barren wasteland. A
barren wasteland may now be greenery. Your previous experiments with time were non-paradoxical,
which is why we meet only now."

"But..."

"Tell me, child, what is it what you are trying to do?"

"I just want to prevent horrible things from happening to my sister, Neiro. I want to fix my sins
and make sure that the terrible things don't happen. I want to make myself whole again."

"Yes, your sister, Neiro Shimohira. You might be in luck, child. There is a certain person interested in
the people around her. Although his vested interest was more concerned with a different
world in the multiverse."

"The multiverse? Is it real."

"Yes, and I and the other Outer Ones sit on top of it, watching it unfold."

The old man then rolled up the sleeve on his right hand, crouched and reached deep into the water.
After a moment, he pulled out a man by the back of his collar. The man was strange.
He had shining red eyes with a triangular pupil, a black over coat and otherwise black clothing,
a black wide-brim fedora which obscured most of his face with a shadow and a generally shadowy
appearance. He is about 175cms tall, of a slim to normal build and has somewhat unruly black hair
which stick out from under the hat in several places.

After the old man pulled him out of his water he stayed bent on his knees and with his hands pressed
against the surface of the water and immediately started vomiting.

The vomit has the color and viscosity of tar, and it looks like there is an oyster in the vomit.
Ella could also see a tentacle in it.

"A little warning might be in order, Xex!" The man says before vomiting again. All of the vomit
sinks under the surface and disperses like octopus ink.

"Long time no see, mag" the old man calmly says without responding at all. Ella is bewildered at what is
happening.

"Sure. What's going on?"

"This woman is the sister of Neiro Shimohira. She is traveling from a reality that will soon cease to
exist. It's a heavenly paradox."

"I see and her existence is unaccounted for then, which is what causes the paradox."

"You are wiser than you look, maggy."

"So the moment I would arrive in the past, everything would go to hell?"

"More or less," mag responds.

"So I can't save my sister?"

"You can, and I have taken a liking to her and her friends, so I will help you."

"You know my sister? How can you help me?"

"I do know your sister. I personally have only spoken to her for not very long, but I have in fact met her
and she seems like a very interesting person. A little angry, a little goofy and a little short. That's what Neiro is."

"In this world where I am not, is she doing fine?"

"Reasonably well, yes. There were some pretty difficult times and very strange events, but she pushed
through them all."

"Ah..."

"Now about how can I help you. You require paradox protection. That means to be plucked out from your former
reality so that you do not disappear with it. Then there is another paradox, two Ellas existing at once.
Xexanoth can fix both of these for a price. But you do not have the means to pay the price. Because you see,
time meddling has a price. The price is fixed and non-negotiable, it is a universal law that cannot be broken.
I will pay the price for you."

"What do you want in return?"

"I want you to succeed. I too think that Neiro deserves a sister."

"Thank you... I am not sure if she deserves me as a sister though... Or if I deserve her as a sister...
what do I have to do?"

"Well, Xexanoth will tell you. Meanwhile, there is a little something you can use."

mag then pulls out a chocolate bar from his pocket and throws it over to Ella.

"Thanks?" Ella responds a bit confused, putting it in her backpack. "Won't it affect my de-aging equilibrium, 
though?"

"That is no longer a concern. The price is now energy, I will cover it."

"Okay.. thank you. So, what do I have to do then?"

"Not flinch," Xexanoth answers the question. He then winds up his fishing rod and swings it. Ella gets again
attached to the fishing hook and Xexanoth pulls the fishing rod up and over his back with a large force which
launches Ella into the air.

Ella then flies about twenty meters backwards and then crashes into the surface and sinks in.

"Godspeed," he says.

.

.

.

Ella wakes up in her old home. She is young now and she feels tiny. She has her backpack on her back and she
has the time travel clothes. They are too big for her now. She is in her bed. Everything is as she remembers
it.

Suddenly, she sees the small Neiro next to her bed.

"Sister... I am so sorry, but I am starving... I know mommy will be mad if she finds out, but please... do
you have anything."

Tiny Ella starts to tear up. "I sure do Neiro." She then pulls out the chocolate bar and gives it to her.

It all starts coming together. But the way will be long and arduous.

# Reverberating sky

Ella has managed to succesfully establish herself a new workshop in this world of past. Turns out that a lot
of people don't notice you doing shady stuff if you are in the body of a child. It allows you to slip under the
radar pretty effectively.

Her new base of operations was in an abandoned warehouse. There was a smaller room inside of it which she dedicated
to be her workshop. The previous owner, whether it was the city or someone else forgot to cut off the utilities, so
she had running water, electricity and gas supply. What more can a girl dream of?

However, her experience with magnusi and Xexanoth revealed to her existence of beings whose threat levels are
beyond those of regular humans. She has therefore decided to fortify her base and put into place several security
measures which should allow her to reasonably defend herself against powered threats. She even prepared a special
weapon for getting rid of those who are impervious to regular armaments.

Today, these measures will prove to be useful and not at all uncalled for.

Ella is sitting at the table in her workshop working on a device which she plans to use in another episode
of her proverbial story of redemption.

Suddenly, someone crashes through the door, kicking it with such a force that the doors fly out of the hinges.
It is a very tall dark-haired man, skinny, strange-looking and wearing a strange coat.

"I am Echo, the god of this realm! I require you reveal the secret of time travel to me, mortal worm!"

Ella turns her head at him and replies: "Space men, fuck off" and then appears to look back at her work.

"Do you dare to oppose me? Tell me or I will kill you, I am the god of this place!" Echo threatens her.

Ella responds: "Okay", and rips off the revolver that was taped under the table. It is a double-action revolver,
the Colt Python 6-inch version, which means that one can immediately pull the trigger and the gun fires a big bullet
that still has manageable recoil. And Ella does exactly that.

Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

She empties the entire cylinder into Echo, throws the empty gun at him, and runs out of the workshop into a small corridor
to the side. This is first of the traps.

Echo lets out an angry growl and promises violence to Ella. He then starts looking creepier, more sickly and menacing. Somehow,
he seems even taller.

He starts giving chase to Ella occassionally throwing stones at high speeds in Ella's directions. These stone bullets can kill
a person very easily if they hit a right place.

However, Ella counted on that. On his way out of the corridor, Echo triggers a tripwire which causes an explosion which incapacitates him temporarily,
dropping chunks of concrete onto him, while he is down, Ella has already reached her emergency weapon stash, she picks up a grenade and throws it
at Echo. As she does that, she picks up a loaded M16A2 automatic rifle and starts firing at Echo.

Echo, however, manages to get up and starts running towards Ella's vantage point and firing stone bullets at her. When he reaches a specific spot
in the warehouse, Ella acquires a new target, she starts shooting at a container that is above Echo right now. It quickly breaks and douses Echo and
his immediate vicinity in corrosive chemicals. Echo touches his face and lets out growls of pain and yells:

"YOU BITCH! I WILL KILL YOU."

"Hmm."

Ella has meanwhile started to fire at the concrete beneath Echo's feet. Soon enough a bullet creates a spark which sets the chemicals on fire.

Blazing inferno.

Ella throws a decoy grenade (one which imitates sounds of gunfire) and when the magazine of her M16A2 runs out, she throws it away and starts
running back to her workshop while Echo is still on fire.

Inside, she grabs an incendiary grenade, which she throws at Echo to slightly prolong the fire.

She then runs over to one of the shelves in the workshop and grabs an armed drone. Ella turns the drone on and sets it after Echo, the
drone starts firing at Echo. Meanwhile, she takes a special device and connects it to the power grid. It will need a while to charge it.

Ella also picks up a remote denoter, which blows off the hinges of a cage in the warehouse. Just as she hoped, the cage is somewhat near Echo.

The cage holds a terrible horror not even nightmares are capable of producing. It is a living breathing sentient mass of malevolence, with
eyes, tentacles and sharp teeth sticking out of it. Sometimes, patches of what appears to be different kinds of hair, including pubic, come
to surface within the writhing mass. The body composition of the monster roughly resembles a half-baked brownie.

Echo has meanwhile managed to dispel the fires through his ability, threw off the remnants of his coat and is starting to pull big chunks of
of concrete out of the ground and lobbing them in the direction of the workshop. This puts several dents in the walls and destroys windows.

The sentient brownie monster jumps at Echo attempting to absorb him. Echo is buried under the sticky goo.

Ella puts on a bulletproof vest and a plastic face shield, as she had no better face protection available, puts a grenade into her pocket and
takes a fully loaded Remington 870 shotgun. She walks into the warehouse and starts firing into the mess of Echo and the brownie monster.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Oh no, Echo killed the sentient brownie, he tore it apart from the inside and remnants of it ended up
all over the walls.

Echo speaks: "This is over you little piece of shit! I will fucking kill you! I WILL DESTROY YOU!"

Bang.

Bang.

Oh no. Echo used his powers to snatch the shotgun from Ella's child hands. He then crushed the barell of the weapon. His hair is turning gray
and dark veins are starting to appear across his body. He seems even taller. He runs.

Echo pins Ella to the ground and tells: "Alright, you little worm. Last chance to tell me how to time travel. I am killing you anyway."

"Look down," Ella responds turning her head to the side and closing her eyes.

On her chest, right in the center of her bulletproof vest is a live flashbang. It goes off and temporarily blinds Echo. The heat from
the flashbang also burned his chest and set him on fire again. Both Ella and Echo are temporarily defeaned. The pressure broke one or two
of Ella's ribs. Breathing is harder, but she pushes through it.

Ella takes the chance and runs back to the workshop. The device is now fully charged, she disconnects it, turns it on an throws
it towards Echo.

Suddenly, the room is plugined into darkness as the electricity in the building goes out. A blue rift in spacetime suddenly appears,
enveloping the room with blue light. Both Echo and the device are sucked into the vortex. This one was future-directional, which means
that Echo will wash up some time in the future. The time fabric rift closes within a few seconds and the power comes back on.

Ella goes back into the workshop. She takes off everything but her panties to inspect her wounds. She has a large bruise going from
between her breast all the way to her left side, where it is the largest. The two ribs down there on the left side are definitely broken.
She touches it and it hurts even to the touch.

Then she notices that there is a cut to the right, above the pelvis. Echo must have hit her with one of the stones and she did not
notice due to the Adrenalin flooding her system. Ella opened up a med-kit and took out the stapler. Without any anesthetic, she started
stapling the wound right after she poured some rubbing alcohol over it.

Clack. Clack. Clack. Clack. Clack. Her face contorts a little with each staple and she grinds her teeth. Finally, the wound is closed.

The throws the stapler to the side and goes over to the sink and washes her hands off the blood.

Ella then slumps down into one of the chairs in the workshop and thinks: "I need to increase security measures."

Next time, she will have a better plan against gods.
