title = "[EN->CZ/IT+Psychology] My thesis about the depiction of mental illness in media"

To graduate from psychology, I wrote a thesis some time ago about the distorted image
of mental illness in media - both television and online. The thesis discusses some of
the most commonly targeted conditions such as psychopathy/sociopathy, OCD, schizophreny,
bipolar disorder and touches upon related topics such as the antivax movement and
autism, multi-level-marketing and the MBTI culture.

The thesis is written in `troff` using a development environment that I have
created to make life easier for me and my friends. I am planning on documenting
my work to make it available for wider use in the future, now it is only enthusiast
level, I would say.

The environment makes use of a Rust tool, or two, the heirloom troff implementation,
the `wendy` inode watcher program, LaTeX unicode fonts, `byacc` Yacc implementation,
and the `plan9port` tool `mk` (as a preferred alternative to `make`, I suggest
checking it out).

Here is a link to the repository:

The repository is named `ambivalence` because I originally developed my environment
for writing my Dark Souls-inspired mythology which is called Ambivalence. Better Name
Pending (tm).

Here is a link to my thesis:

Unfortunately, apart from the English version of the abstract, there is no English
translation and the thesis is in Czech. The thesis was graded A and garnered
acclaim among this year's works.

My friend wrote a thesis in troff that year as well. His work is about the culture and
situation of deaf people in Czech republic and in the rest of the world:
