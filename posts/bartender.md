It has been some times since Lady Winter graced us with her presents. Today, she was cold,
hard and uncompromising. A blizzard is raging and the wind is howling
around the windows. Tonight, the elements rage and present their power for all to see, and man
might feel like just a tiny speck in face of the catastrophic force.

You cannot see the sky, and you cannot see more than twenty feet ahead of you either.
Everything is white. There is snow everywhere, and it is quite a struggle to walk through
the storm. Everything is covered, and one can't tell the difference between road and
pavement.

But not all places are cold and unwelcoming.

The door of the bar diner opens and a wave of cold is felt by the patrons who are sitting
nearby.

It is pleasantly warm here. The air is clear and saturated by the smells of wood, coffee and
good whisky. One can smell a hint of a fancy pipe - Ah! There it is, there is an old man in
the corner reading newspaper, smoking a pipe and smiling while doing so. There is nothing
but contentedness in his face.

Everything here looks vintage, it is like a speaky-easy but without the cruft and the illegal
matters. Most of the furniture is made of wood, just like the bar itself. The lights are very
warm, yellow with a hint of orange, and there is a happy fire crackling in the fireplace on
the other side of the room. The iridiscent lightbulbs produce both light and heat and are very
comfortable to those used to warm colors.

Most of the patrons seem to be quite content. There is a lonely souls and
perhaps wanted to come here to drown their sorrows, and those ones are sitting at the bar
right now, occassionally talking to the bartender.

The bartender is a not-too-old man with friendly blue eyes, a slightly darker complexion, hair swept
back and slight sideburns. It is a vintage look, everywhere outside the bar it is bound to stand
out. He has a mustache and some beard on his chin as well. He is quite animated, making warm,
welcoming expressions and intently listening to the woes of the patrons at the bar.

Oh, right, we have not yet mentioned who just came in. It is a young woman with long black hair,
a slightly elongated face with asian hints and a sharper chin, glasses
and a sour expression on her face. Perhaps, it was the blizzard - after all, her coat was all
covered with bits of snow. That is sure to make one mad, isn't it?

When she came in, there was a man who had just gotten up to retrieve his wallet from his coat,
and since he was already by the hanger, he elected to help the woman with hers.

The woman locked around for a moment to see where to sit, but there is very few empty tables.
The bar is kind of small and gentle, and so at most times, the bartender can run the tables
by himself, employing only part-time waiters and sometimes a single cook in busier seasons.

After a few moments of just idly standing here and perhaps looking somewhere far off into the
eternity beyond the wall, she decides to sit at the bar as well. There were no tables that
were completely empty and she did not have the constitution to sit with strangers right now.
Both the women and the men here mostly looked kind and good-natured but that was not enough to
convince her.

The bartender quickly threw her a glance and zoomed over with the elegance of a failing
elephant: "Hello, Miss, I see you are new here. What can I do for you? Something to drink,
a coffee, a warm meal?"

"Uh, I don't know. Do you have coffee?"

The bartender chuckled and said: "Of course we do, do you have any preference?"

"Not really."

"I see, well, you look like someone who could use a good strong coffee! I'll see what
we can do."

"Thanks."

He than disappeared into one of the backrooms and said something that she couldn't hear
clearly enough to decipher.

After a moment, the bartender emerged followed by a teenage girl,
who then started to make the coffee. Probably a student working here part-time.

"This will only take a moment. In the meantime, what brings you to our humble establishment?"

"Just random."

Soon, the smell of coffee permeated into the air. In combination with the crackling of
the fire, the smooth background music and the quiet chatter of the patrons, it was quite
relaxing.

The bartender lifted his eyebrow, put up a sly smile and then responded.

"Oh, really? There are seldom any random choices at all in life."

The woman just sighed and tiredly answered: "Not if you think that nothing matters
and everything is eventually bound to go to shit anyway."

The bartender was just inspecting a bottle of whisky, and made a "Huh?" face upon hearing
this. The woman pulled in her sweatshirt and rubbed her hands, she was still a bit cold.
The bartender then responded.

"Oh my, what an attitude. See, I've been a bartender for quite some time, and I can
tell you, that no choice is truly random. Even if you do not think about it, you choose
based on things that influence you on a deeper level, emotional and subconscious.
Can you see all the patrons around the place?" said the bartender dramatically looking
over the entirety of the bar.

The woman bent around on her stool to see the people in the bar:
"Yeah, I can?"

"Well, if you asked them why did they choose to sit there they did, you would probably
get one of these two answers: I sat here before, or I picked at random."

"Okay..."

"But I can tell you that all of these people who say random keep selecting roughly the
same spots, it is not truly random. Some people like to be outside people's sight and
hide in the corners. Others will sit close the fireplace, some near the door, others
like to be front and center."

"Aha."

"What's your name, miss?"

"Sorako."

"Oh, are you Japanese, then? You don't look fully Asian to me."

"Only from my father's side."

"I see. Well, Sorako, your parents definitely had to make a choice and go through
some reasoning to name you the way they did, right? I heard that the Japanese especially
place a great deal of value and meaning into given names. But when they named you, they
forever shaped your life."

"What do you mean?"

"Do you know that feeling when you want to say a sentence but it doesn't feel quite
right because of one word? Well, maybe you do not know it as consciously since people
learn to instinctively avoid these situations."

Soroko was absorbed in thought for a second and looked absent-mindedly at the drying
beer glasses. There were some droplets of water racing down their side. Quite mesmerizing
to look at.

.

.

.

Elsewhere, many years ago.

Sorako is in her room, playing with her toys. She has several cheap dolls, but also
some toys she inherited after her brother no longer wanted her. What does this mean
is that Barbie is getting a sweet ride in the garbage truck, for example.

The parents are yelling again. It is at her older brother, Fumihiro. They never quite
understood how to handle him.

She can hear him arguing. He doesn't want to go to medical school, he wants to work
on cars.

The parents are not having it.

"We found cigarettes in your room again, why are you doing this to us?!!"

He tries to argue, but it does not help at all, they are not having it.

"Honey, we raised a drug addict."

The mother cries. Sorako closes the doors to her room and goes back to playing. She
hides underneath a thick blanket.

It is her very own little world, now. She cannot hear what they are saying now.

She cannot listen to it anymore. Why isn't she happy like the other children, she
thinks.

Despite the weighty blanket, she can hear the sound of porcelain shattering on the
floor.

Her mom would always do that, when she got angry. Several rooms still have tiny dents
in the wall from where the dishes landed. The dad keeps covering it up with plaster,
so that guests don't notice it, but mother creates them faster than dad covers them up.

Fumihiro's room is next to her, she can hear him walking over there and the parents
follow suit.

"You know, when I gave birth to you, we thought you would be the flagship of our
family. That you will bring honor to our ancestry, not sully our name," the mother
starts to cry.

"Shut up mom, why do you never let me do what I want??"

"Don't talk like that to your mother!!!" A smack can be heard followed by a painful
ouch. It was not that the slap would hurt so much on the face, rather, it was the pain
of the soul it inflicted.

A loud door slam overpowers every other sound in their home. Sorako's child ears are
ringing for few seconds.

She is really scared, her heart is beating very fast.

Sorako is breathing loudly and heavily and she cannot calm herself. There is a pressure
on her chest.

She knows what's coming.

The door of her room fly open with a malevolent force.

"Where are you? Why are you under that blanket, what are you doing there?!! You
should be studying, so you aren't as much of a disapointment to your family as
your older brother is!! Pathetic failure."

"Okay, daddy..."

"And don't you try doing anything funny. If you don't study, we will send into a
mental facility. So don't be pathetic and learn your math."

"Okay..." Sorako whimpered silently.

She didn't want to leave the perceived safety of her little world. Everything outside
was cold and horrible, and too big for her to handle.

But she had to.

She reluctantly got out of bed and stood up on the cold floor. Her tiny feet got cold
immediately. She went over to her desk and opened up a math textbook and one of her
notepads.

The paper was wrinkled by weeks of being saturated by her tears. Sorako wasn't very good
at math. And some of the text was too small for her, she needed glasses, but the parents
thought that she was making up her poor eyesight so that she did not have to study.

Meanwhile, she heard her brother shuffling around in his room, furiously moving stuff
around.

It sounded like he was packing up.

.

.

.

She snapped out of it, looked at the bartender and said:
"What did you say?"

"I asked if you know that feeling when a sentence but it doesn't feel quite
right because of one word?"

"Uh, yea... I think I do, but what does that have to do with my name and my life?"

The bartender smiled and then twitched both of his eyebrows,
as you do when you want to draw attention to something.

"Different words fit into different sentences. Names are words, too. And so, when
people speak about you, whether they are saying something general, making up insults,
jokes or trying to tell you words of compassion - they will use language that is
compatible with your name. See, my name is Jack, and people can make a variety of remarks
with that name.
But they will be different to the remarks that people make to you. And when they speak
differently to you since early childhood, that will shape you differently. Not only that,
your name shapes the perception others have about you. And not just linguistically, but
connotation as well. If you grew up here, the other children probably gave you hell
for your strange name."

.

.

.

Everybody at school thinks Sorako is weird. She has nearly no friends and most of the
children only use her so they can copy her notes and homework.

Each time, they come pleading with the brightest smile on their face and promise her
heaven, but after she hands it over, she is not their friend anymore, just a creepy
asian nerd.

But she hands it over every time, she knows what's coming, but she at least wants to
feel wanted for a few moments.

There are no other kids with asian heritage in her class, or maybe even in the school.
She does not know for certain because she is afraid of leaving her classroom.

"Oh my god, look at her, why does she look like that? Do they not own a mirror at home.
Oh, I guess you just can't fix a shitty personality."

A: "Gosh, when I woke up after the party, I looked so horrible."

B: "No, really?"

A: "Yea, it was so horrible one of guys told me that if I had black hair, I would be
basically Sorako."

B: "No way, girl."

Sorako was trying to hold back tears. She was looking forward to the new school, hoping to
gain friends, but it was like in elementary, it still sucked.

There was a group project coming up. She knew she would be the hot potato no one would want
in their group, until eventually except maybe for the jocks. They knew they could just offload
all of the work on her and continue revelling in their blissful brawny ignorance.

A few of the jocks did try to score with her whenever she was accidentally invited to a
party, since they thought she was easy. Just a work horse and a meat sack to wiggle their
peepee in, to quote a classic.

Some of them recognized she was actually not at all bad looking, kinda pretty even, and
her beauty would flourish if subjected to proper care and fashion, but they did not want
to admit it to others, so they continued with the group mentality of bullying her.

Come to think of it, perhaps part of her ordeal was coused by their jealousy.

One day, her poem narrowly beat a popular vixen's corny love story. The stories were
submitted anonymously, so no one could tell who is the author. Otherwise, she would
barely get any votes.

_What is a poetess? An unhappy woman who hides deep anguish in her heart, but whose
lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely
music..._

_And people flock around the poetess and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is,
'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for
the cry would only frighten us, but the music, that is blissful._

Whem vixen found out the poet was by Sorako, all of her hatred and anger came to the
surface. She and a few of her dim-witted friends waited for Sorako after school, and
beat her senseless, spilling out the contents of her backpack and tearing up a few
of her books.

They found her lunchbox, the sandwich was uneaten since Sorako was too anxious and
stressed out about the competition to eat. The vixen took it out, kicked Sorako over,
facing up, and threw and smeared the contents of the sandwich on her face.

"There, now you are a pretty idiot sandwich," she finished, spitting on her face. The other
three girls followed suit.

Sorako just laid there for too long to measure, crying and staring at the sky.

What did she do to deserve this?

.

.

.

"They kinda did, yeah. Okay, I get this, but what's your point?"

"The point is that- coffee is here! There you go."

It was one large, lovely cup of coffee. It smelled great and the aroma was gently
evaporating out the top. There was a leaf latte art on top. It's simple, but it is
a nice detail. The woman let out a relieving sigh, as if a part of her burden was just
released.

"Okay, I am listening now."

Strange that Sorako was just content with the bartender speaking about these things,
but the man just had such a gentle voice and friendly demeanor that perhaps
everyone would have listened to anything he said.

Jack started polishing a beer glass: "The point is, Sorako, that unexpected things
influence people in unexpected ways, and there is no such thing as truly random for
humans in this world. So, what brings you here?"

"I could not bear it at home alone. Everything just seemed so strange."

Jack closed one of his eyes, held the beer glass high against the closest light source
and peered through the glass to see if there were still some stains on it: "Strange how?"

The glass was shimmering in the light, but it looked perfectly clean.

"It's hard to explain."

"That is fine, try me."

"It felt as if the world was colorless, emotionless, and time did not matter and kept
flying by. I felt like I stopped for a moment, but suddenly, I realized I had been
staring at the clock for twenty minutes. And this just kept happening. Everything was unreal."

Sorako shuddered, crossed her arms and pulled the sides of her sweatshirt in.

The bartender reached to put some freshly washed plates under the bar, but he responded
from underneath:
"Hmm, and so you decided to go out in a blizzard?"

She sighed and took a sip of her coffee.

"Yes, on one hand, I feel extremely prickly and I might punch someone if they touch me
or speak to me, but on the other, I felt like I needed to hear and see people, and so I
just ventured out."

Jack rose up from beneath the bar with his hair all messed up, he responded
while he was fixing it.

"Must be dire if it's worth it for you to go out into that white hell."

"I felt like I would go crazy if I didn't hear or see another person."

"That is understandable, it is my belief that such is the case for everybody. One cannot
just exist alone in the void."

"But sometimes, I don't want to see or hear anybody."

"Yes, but you'd still know that if you wanted to, you can reach out to someone. And that
you won't end up alone for years at a time."

"Yeah, I guess, sometimes, you just need someone to talk to and vent what's on your mind."

The bartender then jerked his head to the side and made a gesture to the teenage girl he
was working with. She had been waitressing while Jack was talking to Sorako and it appeared
she needs help.

He then looked back at Sorako and said: "Would you excuse me for a moment?"

She nodded her head and the bartender walked off to tend to the other clients.

Sorako looked at the coffee, and swirled her spoon in it, distorting the leaf. There wasn't
very much utility to this beyond releasing slightly more heat out of the cup, but she really
liked when things swirled and it felt interesting to her to look at how the leaf is slowly
disintegrating.

She then took a sip, it was very comforting. Even the darkest days can be improved by a sip
of good coffee, can't they?

.

.

.

.

After a while, the woman next to her reluctantly turned to Sorako and hesitantly spoke:
"Hi, I'm Emma. You said your name was Soraka, right?"

"No, it's actually Sorako. Hi."

"The weather isn't all that good today, is it?"

"It ain't."

The two women then continued to sit awkwardly.

"...You... come here often?"

"Been here quite a few times. It's such a nice place."

"..."

"..."

"You don't have it easy, do you?"

"Heh, more than you could possibly understand."

"I... think I can relate."

"..."

"...Used to be homeless until a few months ago. Everything shattered. We had a big party
years ago, most of friends and family were there. Some random maniac decided he wanted to
join in as well. Almost none of them are alive now."

"I'm sorry..."

"Thank you... Jack, he helped me out. I was desperate and so I broke in here one night,
looking for some cash. He was working early. I threatened him but he instead gave me a
warm meal and talked to me. Let me sleep here for a while until I found a better place."

"That sounds... pretty nice actually."

"Helped me turn my life around."

"Sounds like a good guy."

"I heard he used to be involved with the crime underworld when he was younger, maybe it's
his way of paying penance."

"Maybe."

.

.

.

.

It took a few minutes, but the bartender was finally back.

He went over to where Sorako was sitting and asked: "Sorry, for the delay, everything good?"

Sorako tiredly lifted her head from the coffee cup and said: "Yeah, thank you."

The bartender answered with vigor: "No problem, where were we?"

"I said you just need someone to talk to and vent what's on your mind."

Jack stopped to think and while he was doing so, he took one of the bottles from the
counter and put it back into fridge.

"Ah, alright. It's not just that. You need people, good people, around you who help each other not stray
from the path. Ones who will call you out on your flaws and support you in your virtues."

"But what good is being called out on your flaws? Isn't that just hurtful or annoying
to the person?"

The bartender chuckled and shook his head in polite disagreement.

"I see this often with people who come here. If they have been longtime patrons, then I can
tell you, the person who came here several years ago is different to the person who came here
today. Maybe not in core values, but in many things, and flaws are one of them."

But Sorako had a more defeatist attitude.

"What is even the point of this if your flaws change, it's still flaws."

"They do not change per se, they usually diminish. And it is a long and hard and arduous
journey. You see, people are protective about the self, and if I were to criticize
something about you or your personality, most of the things would make you angry
and defensive."

"No, I don't think so, why would I get angry?"

It is paradoxical, but perhaps the presumption of anger made Sorako a bit angry.

"Because if I take a core value of yours and I question its validity, I have not only
questioned that value, but a part of your being. And not only that, but everything in
your life that is built on that value. And everything that is related to it on a more
superficial level. And now, I would have taken a part of your world and invalidated it.
And it is much easier to get angry than to investigate whether there is any merit
to that claim. If left unchecked, people do have a tendency to choose the easier
path, even if it does not pay off in the long term."

Sorako calmed down and went silent for a bit before responding. She remembered the many
arguments she had with her parents when she was little. And she remembered that when it
came to parents, her older brother had an even harder time.

"Oh... I haven't thought of that. But why would you do that? People shouldn't tell you what
to do, you should live your life as you see fit. Why should they have any say in that? Like,
can they even understand you? How can they then tell you what you should and shouldn't do."

"Yea, I will be right back." The bartender noticed yet another signals from the bar
and so he picked up three beer glasses and started filling them with lager. The he
picked up three smaller glasses and poured some Irish whisky in to each of them.
Afterwards, he slid the tray over to the waitress, who picked them up and distributed
them between the guests.

Everything in the café bar diner was solemn and peaceful, so although the bartender was not
overly involved in business right now, it was fine. The fire was crackling, the music was
playing and the good smells were saturating the air.

Everybody was just enjoying the moment, and why wouldn't they be? There was nothing but
white hell waiting for them outside right now.

.

.

.

After her brother left, the parents were raging and shaken. Little Sorako had no idea
what was going on. Her kid brain could not comprehend the severity of what Fumihiro
did.

The parents, however, knew. They called anyone they could, checked family friends and
relatives, anybody who might know anything.

Nobody knew anything.

Sometime later, it came to light that several of his 'questionable' friends left their
homes as well. It just took a while for the information to find its way to the household.

One thing was for certain, neither Fumihiro nor his friends were in the city anymore.

The wasteland outside was dangerous and barren. There were only ruins and unsavory
people to be found. Traveling to another city was a great risk. At least there was
more of them.

The parents tried to do anything they could to find him for months, spending a large
portion of their savings. Eventually, they found their peace and clung to their hopes.

This incident changed them, perhaps, it made them reconsider their position, and start
treating Sorako better.

She was no longer getting yelled at on the daily and forced to study all the time. They
realized some of their mistakes, and didn't want the same thing to happen with Sorako.

But in some sense, the damage has already been done.

.

.

.

The bartender then returned, tidied up some things beneath the bar and responded:
"Because that's one of the things society is for. Subconsciously, you radiate information
and you broadcast your emotional and mental state to others, and if you do not see that, then
open your eyes. That is exactly what you are doing. I mean, look at your eyes. Have you
noticed how our eyes look quite different from, say, most animals? We have small irises
and a lot of sclera and we are very sensitive to eyes."

"What does that have to do with anything?"

"It is so that we can easily see when people are making eye contact with and so we can
see where their eyes are pointing. See that dude in the very back? Even from here, if he
looked at me, I could tell if he is looking into my eyes or on my chin. And so, we've
evolved to communicate like this. And you need the people you love to tell you when you
are doing something wrong that you are doing something wrong, so that you can think
about what they say and grow."

"My friends don't do that."

"Then find friends who do."

"But isn't it egotistical to find friends who want the best for you and abandon those
who don't? I still think they are good people."

B: "They may be good people but they are not your friends. I had this in my childhood."

B: "You know, I had many childhood friends, you can probably tell, and some of them
would not wish you well. And some of those were aiming up, some of them were aiming down."

B: "And if you have a friend that's aiming down, and you do something that's aiming up,
then they are generally not that happy about it, you know. They try to top your accomplishment,
or put down what you are doing, or offer you a cigarette if you are trying to quit and you
have kinda started successfully with it, or a drink if you've been drinking too much
and are trying to stop being an alcoholic."

B: "Or... or they are cynical and bitter and devoted to no good. Sometimes, it's family
members, too."

S: "Hmm, tell me about it, I have one who is just like that."

B: "See?"

B: "And sometimes, it's even a part of you, you know. Like a force that's dragging you
down."

B: "But you need to think about it differently."

S: "How?"

B: "It's just like you have an ethical responsibility to take care of yourself, you also
have an ethical responsibility to surround yourself with people who have the courage and
faith and wisdom to wish you well when you've done something good, and to stop you when
you are doing something destructive."

B: "And if your friends aren't like that, then they are not your friends. And maintaining
your friendships with them might not even be in their interest either."

B: "And so - it's a tricky argument to make, right - because I am not saying that
whenever anyone is in trouble you should push them into the ditch and give them a
couple of kicks, that's not the idea."

S: "Huh..."

B: "This reminds me of another thing that people are doing if they are trying to drag you
down is that they are trying to see if you put up with it. Because they have this idea that,
maybe, life isn't worth living and things aren't good and if they can besmirch something
that's pristine and good then they demonstrate to themselves that there is no true ideal
and that there is no necessary reason to be responsible and to strive forward."

B: "So they use you as a test case, you know. It's like 'I will push you down into the low
bin and see how you respond and if you put up with it then yeah, my cynicism if fully
justified'."

S: "I see... but this is not nice."

"Unfortunately, such is the case in life. There are many hard and bloody truths, that
are not nice to hear. Hell, some that might even be uncomfortable or painful to hear. But
if you do not recognize them, you will just lead yourself to ruin."

"I don't know many like these."

"I am sure you do, you just need to start recognizing them and facing them. It's like...
you are bearing their weight so you can bear life in its entirety. Sometimes, you need
to visit deep and dark places within yourself that you would have rather wanted to avoid.
And you need to recognize them and bring them in."

"I have a drinking problem. I am trying to quit but I am not sure if I'll make it."

"I believe you will."

"But what if I won't? What if I fail within two weeks?"

"Then I will be wrong once and shall believe again."

"What's the point in that, it would just be disappointment."

"No, it won't, it will be a first step towards success. I've seen it many times here at
the bar. Me, I don't serve the obvious alcoholics. And I don't like to serve alcohol to
people who come to drink alone either. And these people, they would eventually tell me
their story and I could witness it develop myself, over the time. And one might stumble
or become stuck at their hurdles, but most eventually perservere and manage to release
themselves from the chains of addiction."

"So you can just, like, become not addicted one day?"

"Not by itself, it comes hand in hand with other things. Most of the addicts I've met
smoke, or drink or peruse other substances to escape from the hardships of their life,
and from its complexity. It's like - there exists a part of you that is scared of
dealing with what is behind the courtain, behind the drapery. And the reasoning one
might have is that it is difficult to strive for all the good."

"You don't agree with that? For me, it feels really hard to be honest."

"Oh no, I do agree with that, of course. But I would expand on that because
one needs to realize that the negative option is hard as well."

"What do you mean?"

"Communication is hard. Not communicating is hard. Being in debt is hard. Being
financially responsible is hard. Obesity is hard. Being fit is hard. Living life
with addiction is hard. Living life with no addiction to take the edge off is also
hard. Hell, even further. Marriage is hard. Divorce is hard. Being deep in the pit
is hard. Trying to climb out of it is also hard. Like, just think about it, life
will never be easy, it will always be hard. But you can choose which hard you pick.
And hell, do make sure to pick wisely."

"Well, but what do you do to not fall back into addiction?"

"Just as you are trying to quit, you should also start orienting yourself to a
better mode of being. Think in the longterm for what good it will bring. And start
to work on yourself in other aspects, actively work on getting your life together."

"But how do I do that, how do I start? I just have absolutely no idea."

"See, people often have a problem of scope in this aspect. They want to change the world
before getting their own things together. What you should start by is cleaning your room.
Just go and look around it, there will be a ton of things that are in disarray. And some
of the things that are in disarray probably irk you. And so you start by fixing the tiny
things in your room and cleaning it. And then, you adopt a different attitude to life."

"What attitude?"

"Well, the attitude to tending to monsters when they are manageable. Every time you see
something you can fix, fix it. And that is like both in the physical and the metaphysical
world. If there is something you can fix, do it. Because if you leave things unattended,
then they grow into massive monsters that will come to haunt you. And the second important
part of this statement is that, if something is too hard to fix right now, step around it.
Don't let yourself be stuck at it and become miserable and resentful as a result. If you
start fixing tiny things, then in a few months time, your life will be completely different,
and the things that were huge draconic monsters before might become tiny timid geckos,
and suddenly, you can deal with them without extreme suffering."

"Why is it like that, I mean, if it was a huge monster before, why wouldn't it be a huge
monster now as well? Some things seem to  me just so huge and complex that I feel like
I will never be able to tackle them. It feels that it would be easier just to kill myself,
honestly."

"Well, the problem will be still the same, but if you just methodically fix the
tiny things you can fix, then you create a firmer foundation to stand on, and if you
are structuraly sound, you have the ability to deal with larger things. It is not actually
that the dragon of these problems would become tiny, but that you grow to become larger
and stronger."

"Oh, alright, that sounds pretty hard, but also kind of positive."

"There are parts that are not so positive too. You need to deal with other things.
Perhaps the most difficult one is that you have to start avoiding places where you
abused a substance and also friends who continue to use the substance and are not
all too interested in getting sober. And for a long time, you need to forgo things
like 'a casual drink' or a 'single smoke with friends' or 'just one hit' as well.
And you might feel excluded and you might feel yearning, especially if many of your
friends are like this, but it is a price you absolutely have to pay if you want
to survive."

"But what about the friends?"

"Well, the only thing you can do for them is lead by example, show them that there
exists a different, more healthy and responsible mode of being, and that it actually
has benefits. That is the only thing you can do."

"..."

"I would like to get back to some things. Let me tell you a story, if you will."

"Okay, will it be long?"

"Are you in a hurry to go somewhere?"

"I'm not."

"Well, then I suppose it won't be too long for you."

"I had a friend who was a very bitter person. He had a bunch of problems, some of
them were self-inflicted and some of them were I guess you could call it fate.
He had become very, very destructive, murderously destructive. You could see it
in his dreams which he would sometimes share with us.

He lived with me for a while, and I knew him very well, he was a friend of mine
from the time we were children until the time he committed suicide. When he lived
with me, I was trying to help him get on his feet, which was why he had come to live
with me in the first place - he thought I could help him.

He could only take relatively low-level jobs. He had some mechanical ability, but
he didn't get educated, although he was a very very smart person. It was probably like
an IQ of, I don't know, 135 plus. And he was bitter too because he hadn't educated
himself to the level that his intellect would have demanded and he knew it.

So he had to take jobs that were beneath him intellectualy. He had that real
intellectual arrogance because he was smart and really smart people often come to
believe that only smart matters and if they are smart, and all that matters is smart,
but the world isn't sort of laying itself at their feet, then they must have been
terribly betrayed, and then they cling to their intelligence, which is more like a
talent or a gift.

It is more like an idol. A false idol, which is exactly what it is, and it is a very
dangerous one. They get cynical about the stupidity of the world and the fact that
their talents weren't properly recognized. And that's just not that helpful because
smart is a good thing, but I will tell you, if you don't use it properly, it will
devour you, just like all other arbitrarily assigned talents. So you might have a
talent, but it's your friend only if you use it properly, and if you misuse it, it
will be your enemy. And maybe that's how the cosmic scales stay balanced.

Anyway, my friend was a very smart person, although not as smart as he thought he was,
unfortunately, but he hadn't done what would have been necessary with that intelligence
to make it manifest itself properly in the world, and it also made him bitter because
he also knew that there was more that he could have done if would have done it, and
perhaps more that he could still do.

What I was suggesting to him, when he was living with us, cause he was about two steps
from homeless by that point, was that he should find a job he could find, you know,
working in a garage, working in a workshop, something like that because he had some
mechanical ability, and that he should separate himself from the arrogance that made
him presume that such a job would be beneath him because at that point, no job was
beneath him.

But more importantly, it is not so obvious that jobs are beneath people. You know,
I had several waitresses and waiters working here, and some people consider it to
be like an entry-level job for people who can't do anything better or for students,
but I do not believe it. Bartenders, baristas, waiters, waitresses, cooks, there is
art and meaning to those as well.

Imagine, even if you have a job as a checkout person in a supermarket, it is a fairly
unskilled job, you can be some miserable, resentful horrible bastard doing that job.
You can come in there just exuding resentment and bitterness, and making mistakes and
making sure that every customer that passes by you has a slightly worse day than they
need to. And you know, pilfering time, and perhaps pilfering goods, and being angry
about the people who gave you the position because they are above you and talking bad
things and gossiping behind the backs of your coworkers.

And you know, you can take your menial position, self-described, and turn that into
a very nice slice of hell. And you know you go into places like that, I always think
of bars and diners because I used to work in a diner and because obviously.

Here are some bacon and eggs. I know you didn't order it, but you do seem hungry."

Sorako responded: "Thank you, I am a bit hungry, yea. So what's up with the diners
and stuff?"

"Well imagine a diner. You've probably been in this diner, restaurant or a bar. Oh, before
I forget, there is a really good opposite diner, there is a great poem by Bukowski that's
about a diner that works, a good diner. And I actually like that poem and have it here
in the bar. Let me show it to you.

It is a diner where everything is going well. But we are thinking about the opposite
of this diner.

And so you go into a diner, right? It is seven o'clock in the morning and you order some
bacon and eggs and some toast. Then you look around the diner and you think: It was like
30 years since the windows were last washed. And there is a thick coating of a
who-gives-a-damn grease on the walls, you know, and the floor has got the sort of stickiness
that you really have to work on and develop over years.

You know, and the waitress, she is not happy to be there, and the guy behind the counter
is not happy that that happens to be the waitress that he is working with, and then and
you know, you walk down the stairs to the toilet and that is its own little trip.

And so you come back, and you order your damn eggs and your toast and you order your bacon
and it comes. It looks like this:

The eggs are too cooked at the bottom, so they are kinda brown, and they are kinda raw on
top, and they are cold in the middle. And you know, you a really have to work to cook an
egg like that. Like ten years of bitterness will really teach you how to cook an egg like
that.

And then the toast, here is what you do with the toast. You take the white bread, you know,
the pre-sliced white stuff no one should ever eat, then you put that in the toaster and you
overcook it. And then you wait and you pop it out of the toaster. Because it's overcooked,
you scrape it off and you knock off the crumbs so it doesn't look too burnt. Then you wait
until it's cold, of course. And then you put cold margerin on it, not butter, because if
you put cold margerin on you can also kinda tear holes in it, so then it lumps of margerin
it it, and it is really dry, except for where it's too greasy. So that's like its own
little work of art, man.

And then you put that on the side with the eggs, and then you have the potatoes, and this
is how you cook the potatoes properly.

So they are leftover potatoes, and you keep dumping new leftover potatoes into the old
leftover potatoes over weeks, and so some of the potatoes... Well, they are no longer
potatoes, right, they have half-returned to Mother Earth. Then you yeet them on the grill
and you sort of burn them a bit and then you slap them on the plate, and, Jesus, you don't
want to eat those. That's for sure, and that's the point.

And then the bacon. You wanna make sure you buy the lowest possible quality bacon, that's
how you start. And then you throw it on the grill, and the grill has to be overheated to do
this, you have to cook the bacon so that it's raw in places and burnt in other places, and
it has that delightful cancer-inducing odor that only really cheap badly cooked bacon can
provide.

Or maybe you use those little breakfast sausages that no one in their bloody right mind
would let within fifty feet of anything living. And then you serve that. And you serve it
with the kind of orange juice that is only orange in color.

And with coffee, ugh, that was started too early in the morning, that's the first thing.
Bad quality coffee started too early in the morning. Got cold once or twice and has been
reheated. And then you serve that with something that resembles whitener more than anything
else.

It is like: 'WELL HERE IS YOUR BREAKFAST.'

And, like, no, man, that's no breakfast, that's Hell."

"Haha, well, hope you don't make breakfasts like this here. These eggs and bacon are
pretty good though"

"No, we don't, thank you, but you get the point right. Even if it takes work, things that work in
harmony are much better for all people involved. And this is part of the responsibility
to take care about yourself and by extension surround yourself with good friends. Because
if you don't, Hell emerges. And not just for you, but for the people around you as well."

"Why shouldn't I just kill myself and get everything over with? My older brother did it."

"Did he? I am sorry, what happened?"

"He had it tough at home, he was not an easy kid. He was a lot older then me, so I don't know
that much, but he used to get into kahoots with the wrong people. You know, after the
Great War, there was a lot of bad people around."

"I see, and something happened to him while there?"

"No, no, it didn't. He ended up running from home one day, just could stand it. He was
doing drugs."

"Ah, I am sorry to hear that."

"He somehow ended up going all the way down south, crossed where the border used to be.
We don't know how he got there, we didn't hear from him since he left home."

"When did you find out about him?"

"It was when he killed himself. Or... we are not even sure, maybe it was an overdose.
Nobody knows for sure."

"That's disheartening."

"My parents couldn't even see his body, since we cannot travel that far south. Not this
year, maybe not ever. You know how hard it is to even leave your city. Most of the land
is just a deserted wasteland."

"Was there someone with your brother?"

"Yeah, he had a girlfriend, she is or was, I don't even know if she is still alive, a
crackhead too. Worst thing, two small daughters."

"That's terrible, what happened to the girls?"

"There is no way the family can go fetch them, it is too far. After my brother died,
they went into orphanages probably. We don't even know where. They should be in their
teens now, my brother died when I was nine."

"I see, well, I wish you one day have a great family reunion."

"Thank you, but tell me. Why shouldn't I just off myself? This is only one thing that
makes my life terrible."

"Now, I cannot tell you what it takes to escape that mentality but I can tell what I
believe to be the perspective from the outside."

"What is that, is that like the non-sense that I have so much to live for, that there
are people who love me, and so on, and so on?"

"No, well, it partly touches that, but not entirely."

"Okay, what is it then?"

"Well, there is one or two things to say about that. First of all, I think you have
to think very carefully about the consequences of that for other people. So I have
met people who never recovered from the suicide of a family member or of a friend,
decades later, they are still torturing themselves about it. Perhaps even drowning
in alcohol, smoking everything that burns or worse things, you know. It doesn't look
that the experience with your brother was easy on you and your family either."

"But then that isn't a problem that you can just solve properly with regards to addiction,
is it?"

B: "Well, you can solve, or more accurately learn to live with it in such a way that you
aren't in constant agony, but it's difficult, and it takes time."

B: "And so, this impact is what you leave behind. Now the problem is you might be
dreaming about it maybe because you are feeling that life is betwisted against you
and that people deserve to suffer for the misery that they have imposed upon you.
But I would say... think very very carefully before you go down that route. It's a
terrible thing to leave people with."

S: "I won't care about what I leave behind once I am dead."

B: "You won't? Isn't that egotistical? I believe you do, everyone does to a degree.
And to say this to lie to yourself. Because, you see, this won't just affect the bad people,
it is not a legit means of revenge. It will hit especially those who love you and
care about you, perhaps even harder than your tormentors. Revenge is suboptimal, I
think, but if you have to do it, do it differently."

B: "Anyways, you might also think, if you are really depressed 'well those people would
be better off without me', this thinking is likely, I've seen it many times. And if you
get really depressed you can even get to the point where you can't think about any other
way, and at that point you should probably seek professional help."

S: "But what if I really feel like there is nothing good that my existence brings about?
That I am absolutely hopeless, good for nothing, that I will never amount for anything,
that I won't achieve anything meaningful, that I am just a burden? What if I believe
that it is a great mystery that I even reached this age?"

B: "Well, I think it is not obvious that anyone can ever be not useful and capable of
doing anything meaningful. See, sometime ago, I met two guys who were working for an
electrical company, they were fixing wiring, right? And they looked kinda strange, so
I went up to them and struck a conversation."

S: "How strange were they?"

B: "Well, physically. It turned out that one of them had early onset Parkinsons and the
other used to be an aspiring sportsman back in his teens but a motorcycle accident just
completely brutalized most of his body. And so these two both had huge physical disadvantages,
but they complemented each other. Sure, together they were doing the work of what would
have been a one-man job, but they were working and they were useful. Thanks to them,
and many other people like this, the lights are on. And I don't know about you, but I
consider all these little things in the world that we mostly don't even notice, to be
bloody miracles. The lights are on, we have electricity, and the work that it took
mankind to get to this point is nothing short of a miracle."

S: "Oh, I see, and what were the two guys like as people? Were they miserable?"

B: "Not at all because they had found meaning and fulfillment, they have responsibility.
And I believe that this is something we have forgotten but have known for a very long
time. People need to adopt responsibility, you have to have your burden or carry it, or
else you just descend into chaos, and rot, and die. Everybody keeps yammering about rights
here, rights there, but rights are married to responsibilities, and you need both to
function."

S: "But having rights is important, though."

B: "Yes, exactly, I am not saying they aren't or that we shouldn't keep fighting for
meaningful rights, just that the debate should be exapnded to include responsibilities
as well."

B: "But... I digress. There is the possibility that your condition is physical,
that you are ill in some way, either physically or perhaps you have a psychological
problem. Maybe you were hurt or... there is lots of reasons that people get depressed
that are very very complex."

S: "Yeah... and what about that, then?"

B: "I would say, don't give up hope and do something final before you have explored
all possible options. And you owe it to yourself and your people to explore every
possible avenue before you take such a step..."

B: "And then you also don't want to deprive the world of what you could bring to
the table! That is the other thing, you know, you do have intrinsic value and you
can't just casually put that into an end. And just poke a hole in the fabric of
being itself."

S: "..."

B: "I briefly met a guy, he worked at a maximum security prison, a very strange fellow.
And he had this quote he would say: 'You can always commit suicide tomorrow'.
And that's like a very flippant statement in some sense, but he meant it in a very
serious way."

S: "How did he mean it?"

B: "It's like, you only get to decide that once. And you can put it off, so I would
say, if you have the idea of a suicide, just try putting it off, postponing it. Then
put it off some more, and see what you could do to put yourself together. Explore
every possible option. And you can try working on all sorts of things because
what do you possibly have to lose? If you already started seeing suicide as an
option, then hell, you can just go and try things, and there is nothing you could lose."

B: "And you know, think again about the people around you. You cannot fix someone's
suicide, you are stuck with it. And you torture yourself with it for the rest of your
life, like 'if I would have only known', 'if I would have only said something different'...
and so on."

S: "Hmm, I see... I'll think about it."

B: "There is this one final thing, I would say about this. And it might make you angry
at first to hear this. Do not be so sure that your life is yours to take. You don't own
yourself the way that you own an object. You have a moral obligation to yourself as a
locus of divine value, let's say. Please, explore everything you can explore to get
yourself back on your feet, all the things. Don't leave the people around you with
that to suffer from for the rest of their life. Don't underestimate your value in the
world, and don't understimate the fact that suicide is wrong. And so those are some
reasons you shouldn't end your life soon... or at all."

"This is all hard to process, but thank you. Do you talk like this with everyone,
who comes here?"

Sorako stretched out, after all, it's been a while of being slouched at the bar and
listening, and questioning. The coffee was already cold, but she only drank half of
it. Nevertheless, it was still a very good coffee. Made with care and harmony, she
could tell. There were almost no uncovered windows in the café bar diner, perhaps
because of the absolutely horrible weather of last days the bartender wanted to
prevent windows broken by the elements, but there was still a few small irregular
panes of glass in the door, and Sorako could see that the storm is calming down.

Inside the bar, no one would even notice it, it was like a different world here,
and a different time as well. It felt more like a calm world of yesteryear than
the hectic time of today, maybe that is a sentiment that appealed to the bartender.

"I do like to talk with people. But it depends, some people come here for a nice
small talk, others come to offload their worries. Some come seeking counsel, me,
I try to provide everything I can for a good time. I mean, I enjoy this, you see,
I had a dark time in my life at one point and at the time, talking to people like
this was surprisingly, despite my temperament, the only thing that brought meaning
into my life. And I clung to it, and I carefully watched people and did my best
for them, and I always enjoyed seeing them better themselves over time. Sometimes,
yea... it did happen that people disappeared or changed for the worse, but I guess
that is the duality of life. And even for those, I try to have hope."

"That's... okay, I did not expect that. Why are you here?"

"Here, this bar? Well, I like it here, it is such a nice place to maintain and be in,
you know? And I get to talk to people and the like. Good smells, nice atmosphere."

"Well yes, but why did you make it build it here? You look different than the
people who live here. Strange clothes, different face."

"Well, to be honest, I'm waiting."

"Waiting for whom?"

"I made a promise some years ago to a person, and I want to honor my word."

"You think they will come here?"

"Yeah, I know it. I know one day, that person will come into these lands and I will
be able to see them again and fullfil my word. It's a promise, that I carry here
everyday," Jack finished, tapping his temple.

"What if they won't come? Maybe they will never be found again, lost forever?"

"They will, they always will. Hope will be the last thing I lose, haha."

"Alright, okay. I have one last question for you before I go, but I will come again.
How would you say one copes with life?"

Jack the Bartender leaned back and ran his right hand through his hair, and stared
at the ceiling for a moment, thinking. The ceiling was made of wooden logs which
went in like a criss-cross pattern. Some of the wood looked quite old and occasionally,
there was an imperfection in the wood, but together, it held quite nicely, and no
one felt like this ceiling would be collapsing anytime soon. The inhabitants of the
top floors possibly even had no idea what was underneath their feet because it just
never stopped working the way it should work.

The bartender then snapped back to reality, looked at Sorako, and spoke: "I think...
I think the answer is to have a life worth living, and then the question is, how to
have a life worth living? Tell me... do you read books?"

"I do, kind of, yea."

"What sort of books? What genres?"

"Uh, all of them, I mean, I have been reading a lot of Japanese literature lately,
to get in touch with my pops' culture, for example."

"That's a good answer. Read _I Am a Cat_ by Natsume Soseki, if you haven't already.
Great book, but I digress. Have you read Dostoevsky?"

"Some of his works, not much."

B: "Well, if you want to explore the world and the inner works of a person's mind like
no other way, read Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky was a guy who had a very special kind of
epilepsy, don't know if you've heard about it. A certain amount of people experience
something called aura preceding an epileptic seizure. And this state is really
interesting mentally."

S: "How so?"

B: "It shows the clear connection between mind and the brain, which we often do not
think about. I heard about this guy, and in his aura, he felt like someone was looking
at him from behind. And if he turned around to see who it was, he would get an
epileptic seizure."

S: "Huh, that's really interesting."

B: "It is, and Dostoevsky had another type of aura. It was like some of his thinking circuits
going into overdrive. He explained something like as if meaning suddenly started infinitely
revealing itself out of everything to him, and it would just continue to go deeper and
deeper. And so he would see connections and meanings in things that no one would normally
notice, and that influenced his work greatly. Hell, the aura is such a strange phenomenon
that just so they can experience it again, some epileptics don't take their medication
or even take steps to provoke a seizure, can you imagine that?"

B: "Dostoevsky said that in 'Notes from the Underground', a great great book and I love it,
it was his an early criticism of the notion of a political utopia. He said: Look, if you
gave people everything they wanted, if they had nothing to eat but cake and nothing to
do but sit in warm pools and busy themselves with the continuation of the species,
the first thing they would do after the first week was go kind of half insane and smash
everything up, just so that something that they didn't expect would happen, so
that they'd have something interesting to do."

S: "Damn."

B: "Yeah, it's so right because the utopian notion that if you just had
all the material stuff you wanted that you would be... well, what would you be?
What would you do? Would you just sit in the couch and watch TV, play games,
consume media? I mean, you would be cutting yourself just for entertainment
in no time flat.

B: "That's the sort of thing that people do. We are not adapted for security and
utopia. We are adapted for a certain amount of security because we are vulnerable,
but mostly we want to have one foot out where we don't know what the hell is
going on. Because that is where you are alert, and alive and, tense."

B: "I believe it actually has something to do with the hemispheric structure
of the physiology of your brain. It because the right hemisphere looks roughly
adapted to what you don't know and the left hemisphere, and this is an
oversimplification, but a useful one, is adapted to the world that you do know.
And the right place for you to be is halfway between them."

B: "You can tell that this is actually the reality manifesting itself to you.
That sense of active engagement you have in the world when things are working well for you,
you know where you should be at the right time, you are alert and on top of things,
and engaged and you do not have much of a sense of time."

B: "And more importantly, the sense of the tragedy of life sort of recedes, and
that is when you have got one foot where it is secure and one foot out in the unknown.
And your brain signals to you that you are in the right place by making what
you are doing meaningful."

B: "And that sense of meaning is actually a neurophysiological signal that you have
got the forces of the cosmos properly balanced in your being at that moment and that
is why it feels so good. And now, well, what else could it possibly be?
You know the brain is capable of looking beyond our vision, that is what it
is for, and regarding that sense of engagement there is no reason to assume that
it is anything but a real signal."

B: "You can reduce it and you could say: Well, the problem with being where
you know only, is that you do not know everything and that is going to be a
problem in the future. And the problem with being where you know nothing is
that it is just too much, you go into panic mode because anything can happen
there and you can't handle it."

S: "So you have to be inbetween on this, then?"

B: "Yes, you have got to mediate between those two things. You want to be secure
enough so that your physiology is not revving out of control, and you want to
be out there in the unknown enough so that you keep updating yourself
constantly. That's the place where information flow is maximized.
That is where you are when you're having a really interesting conversation with someone, or
you are gripped by a book or you are really into a movie or maybe something that you do
apart from your work, or maybe even in your work, if you're into it and
because you are in the right place at the right time, and your whole
nervous system is signaling that to you."

B: "I would say that is the sort of place that you should be in all the time.
Of course, you can't be because no one is perfect, right but it is the recreation
of Paradise on Earth, in some sense. Because you are in the right place at the right
time when that is happening."

B: "And we are mobile creatures, right, we need to know where we are going
because all we're ever concerned about, roughly speaking, is where we're going,
if you think about it."

B: "That's what we need to know: Where are we going, What are we doing and Why
are we doing it. It turns out that the way that we're constructed neurophysiologically
is that we do not experience any positive emotion unless we have an aim and we can see
ourselves progressing towards that aim."

S: "So you should achieve some aim to have a good life?"

B: "Hmm, not exactly. It is not precisely attaining the aim that makes us happy,
as you know if you have ever attained anything because as soon as you attain it,
then the whole little game ends and you have to come up with another."

B: "It is like the story of Sisyphus, and that's okay, but it does
show that the attainment cannot be the thing that drives you because it
collapses the game. That's what happens when you graduate from university.
It is like you are king of the mountain for one day, and then you go, like, surf at
at Starbucks for the next five years, if you do not figure out your next goal."

B: "So what happens is that human beings are weird creatures because we're
much more activated by having an aim and moving towards it then we are by
attainment and what that means is you have to have an aim. And that means you
have to have an interpretation and it also means that the nobler the aim,
that's one way of thinking about it, the better your life."

B: "That is a really interesting thing to know because you have probably heard
ever since you were tiny that you should act like a good person and you shouldn't
lie, for example, and you might think: Well, why the hell should I act like a good
person and why not lie?"

B: "Even a three-year-old can ask that question because smart kids
learn to lie earlier and they think: Well, why not twist the fabric of reality
so that it serves your specific short-term needs? That is a great
question why not do that, why act morally if you can get away with it."


B: "It brings you closer to something you want, well, why not do it?
These are good questions, since it is not self-evident. It seems to me tied in with
what I just mentioned. You destabilize yourself and things become chaotic - that is not
good and if you do not have a noble aim, then you have nothing but but shallow trivial
pleasures and they do not sustain you. And that is not good because life
is difficult. It is so much suffering, it is so complex, it ends and everyone dies,
and it's painful."

S: "..."

B: "Without a noble aim, how can you withstand any of that? You can not you become
desperate and once you become desperate things go things go from bad to worse very rapidly.
And so the idea of the noble aim is not something that is just necessary, it is the
bread that people cannot live without."

B: "It's to confront chaos, it is to make a better world, or something that that's
enought of a noble aim so you can stand up without, you know, cringing at the very
thought of your own existence. It is so that you can do something that's worthwhile
to justify your wretched position on the planet and, whatever it is that is you, has
this capacity to experience reality and to transform it."

B: "And this is a very strange thing to realize. You can conceptualize a future in your
imagination and then you can work and make that manifest. You participate in the process
of creation. It is an amazing idea because it gives consciousness a constitutive role
in the cosmos."

S: "Well, I guess, but fuck, I will need some time to digest that."

B: "No worries, come again, haha."

S: "How much for the coffee?"

B: "If you come again, it's free."

Sorako then reluctantly rose from her bar stool and went for the exit.

"What did you say your surname was, Sorako?"

"Shimohira, I am Shimohira Sorako."

A gust of cold wind blew into the bar as the door closed behind her.

A short while later, a Japanese man walked into the establishment. Jack was waiting for
him and signalled him over to a secluded salon in the back.

That was the last person they were waiting for, the rest was already seated in the back
room, some of them already enjoying a coffee or a glass of something else.

Apart from the Japanese businessman, there were two women, one of them was Eir, the other
one had blue hair, part of which was vowen into dreads, colorful markings on her face,
blue to purple eyeshadows that spanned far longer than eyeshadows usually do and a outfit
that heavily relied on fishnets. Unfortunately, this made her nipples visible through the
fabric, but she clearly did not care.

One woman was missing amongst them, she unfortunately died a long time ago, and yet, she
was still sorely missed by the rest of the crew.

Actually, two people were missing, but the old man, who had a fearsome reputation and
quite a few years behind his belt, would only show up on whim, so nobody was really
expecting with certainty that he would come.

Then, there were three men seated total in this group. There was a energetic Scotsman with
red-blonde hair, who was, at this point, half-way through a pack of cigarettes, and a gloomy
man in an overcoat with a scar running over his eye and another making a gap on the left
side of his hairline. He was enjoying a pipe and looking somewhere off into the unknown.

Jack came to great them: "Lads, welcome, I'm happy I can provide accomodation for us today,
it's been quite a while since we last met each other like this. We are missing one, but...
yeah, we all know. Still, glad to have you here. Can I offer you something else? Food, drinks,
coffee?"

The group collectively responded that "they are fine, thanks".

The gloomy man then pierced Jack with a sharp stare and asked: "What's up with that girl?
Is she a part of the scheme, too? Or what do you do with her?"

"Uh, nothing, she was just a new guest, lightly troubled. You know I like to talk to people."

The blue woman responded: "She was kinda cute, you got her number?"

Red-blonde: "Fuck off, you know you are no good for an innocent girl like that. But fuck,
Jack, or what name do you go by nowadays, don't you think your talents are wasted in this
shithole."

The blonde woman: "A man of your ability should be in the field, not being a goody-two-shoes
behind the bar."

"I don't enjoy cutting up and sewing up people like I was doing years ago. I have had enough
blood, I think. No more surgeries for me. If I want to poke in somebody's head, I think words
are preferrable."

The Japanese man responded with perfectly clear English: "Sure, whatever floats your boat,
but keep in mind, you have to make sound investments. Do you think this will pay off better?
Weigh the risks and the possible profits and make the most informed decision."

"I am fine doing my own thing, thanks, Tachi."

Tachi retorted: "Being a little bitch, again?"

"...Now, let me get to the matter at hand. Once again, it appears that we are pulling a scheme,
and here I thought this is behind us. It would be better if the old man decided to show up,
but no, he won't come, that dick. I guess we will just have to do with just us here the
document."

Eir responded: "Honestly, I haven't seen him in years, jeez. Also, I appreciate being pulled
in into another scheme just when I found a good job at a reputable company."

The Japanese man complained: "I was supposed to have a business meeting, and then, a two
week relaxing trip the nature of my homeland. Ruined."

The blue woman decided to butt in as well: "I was going to be meeting with some hot people
that got some hot stuff. Sells pretty good lately. Very new, not illegal yet. Gets you all
the way to heaven."

Scotsman wasn't having it: "Fuck off, junky."

The gloomy man decided to end this little detour: "Think you should be done for now. Now,
can we do something productive? I don't have all day. What's on agenda?"

"Well, we should probably clear up anything we don't understand in the document."

Tachi nodded and said: "Yes, finally."

Eir asked: "Does everybody have a copy?"

"Yea."

"Mhmh."

"Here."

"Of course, I do."

"Yep."

"Uuuh, seem to have forgotten mine," finished the Scotsman.

"Per usual," Eir sighed, "I brought an extra, here."

"Thanks, love."

The ones who weren't perfectly familiar with it then spend a while reading
and sifting through the material, while others occupied themselves with drinks and food.
The gloomy man just stared into the ceiling.

Jack in the meantime just went back to tend to the bar.

After a while, the blue woman popped her head out into the room and yelled at Jack:
"Hey, uh, I think we're good?"

He then went back in.

"Alright, so how we doing?"

The gloomy man answered: "This is bullshit. Waste of time, fuck off."

But some of the others disagreed.

"Okay, let me phrase it better. Who's in? I am."

"Not me."

"I am"

"Nah mate."

"Count me in."

"Yeah, it's gonna be fun."

"Okay, fine."

Eir then continued: "Alright, now we have this out of the way. Let's get into discussions
and booze, am I right?"

Jack ended with: "Good call. Everybody, say what you want!"
