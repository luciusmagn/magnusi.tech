The purpose of this website is to store some information
about me, some of my notable projects, pieces of my writing
and small articles.

The content should fall under the following categories:

- Programming (mainly Rust)
- Other topics and my stories
- Cool things I have found
- Media files
- Materials for my programming classes (now at gjk.cat) -> [GJK.CAT](https://it.gjk.cat)
<br>

Legacy versions of this website also served to view information
about the now-dormant C2 package manager, __Pebble__, and the two
experimental education oriented programs, __gjkbot__ and __rustgrade__.
