title = "magnusi"

magnusi is a very old powered being. These beings are often referred to as
'deities', although both he and most of others dislike this classification
since it implies a sense of egotism and is a rather nondescript and strange term,
but it is a commonly used classifier. In older ages, these beings were born in generations,
magnusi is a first gen being with a primary affinity for water (i.e. ocean deity) and a
secondary affinity for dark (i.e. like Hades, Nyx, Shalim, Nott, Zorya, Tezcatlipoca
and so on). Furthermore, these beings have a designation based on their primary approach to
dealing with problems. Some types are offense, defense,  stealth,
sensory/observation, psychic and others. magnusi is an observation
type with abilities centered in particular around his sight.

Within the world, mag is the very first and therefore the oldest of these in
existence, his coming about being brought forth by the death of the first human
child. This alludes to an old job he had as a psychopomp, where he would ferry
the souls of dead children into the underworld. His oldest peer is the death
god, who appeared when the first human adult died. This one is often
called Kai but is mostly recognized by the name of Amenotokotachi/Tachi, which he
acquired in the Japanese pantheon. The first generation is strange in that they
were born out of a world tree and are not genetically related, this has
led to an interesting schism where the first gods consider some of the other first
gods to be like siblings and other to be romantic interests. mag is notably without
a love interest in the first generation.

A second job was handed to magnusi much later by the other gods, which was to
oversee Hell and ensure its continuous operation. This position comes with a
curse since by way of watching over liars, it is required that he who watches
them is not a liar himself. Therefore it is physically impossible for magnusi
to utter any lie. This curse is upheld by the entirety of the divine body which
makes it pretty much certain that there is no chance for magnusi to lie ever at
all. However, he can be deceptive with other things, his body, his actions, obscure
phrasing, his gestures, within jokes and so on. This comes in handy since mag
is a trickster deity, and in fact, many of the world mythologies' trickster gods
are just different names for magnusi, for example Sun Wukong for when he wreaked
havoc in the Chinese pantheon.

Despite being very old, magnusi is nowhere near the top of the hierarchy, he
set forth some ground rules back in the day, but he does not enjoy in particular
ruling over other gods and people and high politics, or any other types of political
activity at all. This leads to him being considered more of a counselor, but
mostly a comedic relief or a nuisance. Within the first generation, magnusi is
considered to be the weakest and most strange god. His original body bore many
defects which severely limited his ability and required him to expend significant
energy to make up for these flaws. These include damaged legs, hand, lungs,
liver, inner ears and heart. Many of the first few generations had bodies besat
by defects, though. Most crippled was the aether one, who in one timeline ended
up succumbing to her illness. Eventually, mag reached a state where he was able
to shapeshift and freely change his internal structure, mostly alleviating many
of these flaws.

In appearance, magnusi is a bit shorter, has black hair, usually
very short, but sometimes longer, unruly and spiky when wearing his signature
hat, he is very pale, and also skinny, sometimes to the point of looking heavily
malnourished and skeletal, although this varies. His face is much skinnier and a
fair bit narrower and more skeletal than mine and he has large dark bags under
his eyes.

His eyes are the most defining feature. They are notable by having a inward
curved triangular pupil with the corners cut off (well, it is as if the curved
triangle stretched past the iris). The iris was originally blue, and in fact,
magnusi is the person who introduced the blue eye genes into the human
genetic pool by way of replacing a dying human's cells with his own to save his life,
but after an event which involved extreme injuries, pain and long torture, his eyes
were so bloodshot that the blood managed to flow between the iris and the sclera
and dye it red. As a memento of this trauma he survived, a sign of a change in
mentality and also as a psychological weapon, he kept the red color and actually
made his irises be red. For added effect, the irises can shine brightly in the
dark as well if required to scare an opponent. In most battles, mag ends up
heavily injured, often dismembered or disemboweled, the fact that he is able to,
move, attack, speak and regenerate from that states further serves to discourage
opponents.

Mechanically, the eyes are special in that they are threaded (like a screw is, or
a camera lens) and how far on the thread the back part of the iris is denotes the
distance the eyes are focused on. Therefore to refocus, both the iris and the pupil
must spin. mag can focus on two things independently, so the eyes can spin independently
also. Usually, the spin is imperceptible to the human eye, but mag sometimes slows
it down as a psychological weapon, that is, to freak out whoever looks at him.
The inner mechanics of the eye and anything beyond the strange color and the shape of
the pupil is not visible from the outside.

The eyes are called "analytical eyes" and they have much better visual capabilities
than human eyes. They can observe virtually all light, measure distances, look
into objects (by selecting different types of radiation, or in tandem with bending
light), see sound waves, calculate trajectories, they have a much wider field of view
and differently shaped also (they can see better to the sides and up because of their
shapes), they can see very fast objects, they have a very high range and also can see
very fine details at shorter ranges, they can calculate how long will certain
movements take, see in pretty much complete dark (if pitch black, the shine of the
eyes is used), and pretty much anything else that can be expected from a perfect
sensory organ.

After previous experiences, the eyes are also made to withstand pretty much any
damage without it having any noticeable effect on them. They also have a second
stage, where the right eye becomes a circle where one can't differentiate the
pupil from the iris, both kind of melting together and taking on a dark red color,
and the left eye becoming larger, taking on a circular pupil that is concentrical
with two circles. This creates a pupil surrounded by two stripes. Within each
stripe, 'squares' of black and red iris matter alternate. The stripes have a
amount of blocks, so that they do not line up. These two stripes can spin independently
of one another. In this form, the eyes are referred to as the Time (right) and Space
(left) eyes, where the Time eye has very poor actual eyesight, to the point that it
would require strong prescription glasses, but can look a very short amount of time
into future and a much larger period of time into the past. It also makes locally
speeding up and slowing down time easier and more effortless. The space eye becomes
much sharper and provides much greater visual prowess and allows extremely fast
localized teleportation of objects, bending of space and other related abilities.
It is a rare occurrence for mag to use these eyes, especially both at once, since it is
extremely energy consuming and causes heavy bleeding from the eye sockets. The difference
between these and regular eyesight, especially if used together, also causes heavy nausea
and headache.

magnusi also utilizes a lot of tiny usually-invisible eye-balls, some of which
he leaves suspended in places that require monitoring, some of which he sends
to travel and observe things around the world, and some of which he keeps around
himself to give him an visual edge in situations. Usually, he keeps about
40 of these eyes floating around in his vicinity. This is for two reasons,
heads up, and theatricity (so that he gets cinematic shots for his memories).

magnusi is actually to a large degree theatrical. He telegraphs his attacks,
he makes strange gestures and says some arcane sounding one-liners, introduces
weaknesses to his strategy, lets himself get injured by his opponents and usually
tries to make fights long and balanced. Most of the things he does in battle are
also intended to scare or intimidate his opponents, and in best case prevent
the battle at all. magnusi does not like needless physical conflict, and so he employs
ploys and psychological warfare to prevent most conflict.

As for a general listing of skills and powers, it is this:

- hydrokinesis (the primary real power, very many others are derived from this through years of study)
- time dilation*
- teleportation (through portals only, the effect of personal teleportation is achieved by opening a
  magnusi-sized portal and throwing the portal across himself),
- high physical abilities*
- visual prowess,
- fake telekinesis (magnusi actually wraps items in a nearly invisible film of water, or
  grabs items by their water content),
- swordsmanship*
- physical flexibility*
- electrical discharge (since magnusi is basically water, he was able to construct a makeshift battery
  in him which electrical attacks of others charge and he can discharge)
- shapeshifting,
- fake intangibility (by shapeshifting into a gaseous form)
- temperature manipulation
- fake levitation (either repelling himself from underground bodies of water or walking on thin films
  of water/ice he can suspend in air),
- space bending (to make objects seem smaller or bigger or to redirect objects, and look around the corner)*
- fake illusions (actually mist constructs or tangible constructs which are made to seem to the person like
  they are hallucinating, sometimes, mag can also manipulate the small amount of water that is on the surface of
  the eyes to affect the light passing in)
- very limited form of telepathy (can talk with people telepathically but not read their minds or do mind control)*
- extreme regenerative powers (so long as there is energy, magnusi can generally reconstitute, however, due to
  adrenalin circuits being taken out, not only does he feel the pain of every injury the
  same way as humans, he feels it even to a greater degree because there is no adrenalin
  response), can donate cells and organs to others as healing.
- creation of water clones (they look real but when injured they bleed water and
  when they are destroyed they disperse into water)
- creation of biological matter*
- profound knowledge of most sciences, which he uses to do experiments, study further and sometimes make abominations
  against God in form of creepy monsters (but most creations are not that horrific),
  knowledge of technology which he uses to create all sorts of gadgets,
- survival instincts,*
- very poor luck*
- cancer blood (his blood is a toxic cleansing agent which heals injuries but also spreads his personality traits
  to those who consume it - that's the toxic part)
- cunning and scheming*
- interdimensional travel and the creation and maintenance of pocket dimensions*
- light suggestion (basically a hell power, by making an eye contact with someone to spread his eyes - the 'infected'
  look like they have mag's eyes to everyone except other infected, infection spreads through eye contact. The infected
  have a lot of their filters removed, are more prone to be honest and act on instinct and can be lightly pushed to do
  something they want to do at least a bit - so it is a power of light suggestion)
- intimidation and fear induction*

_items marked with asterisk are common with most others and not mag-specific, or are not supernatural in nature_

And this should be roughly it, although the power set is really expansive, is not tightly defined.

Of note is shapeshifting, a power often utilized by mag to hide in plain sight, study the world,
or to quit out on supernatural life. It is common for mag to shapeshift into a much healthier looking form
in order to not scare friends and not to reveal weaknesses to enemies. Alternatively, a 'true-damage' form exists,
which materializes all injuries that have ever been suffered by magnusi, transforming him into what is basically a
mass of scar tissue and bullet holes roughly in the shape of a man. This is often used to intimidate weaker-willed
opponents. To appeal to certain types of people, this ability is also used to introduce more endearing or fairy-tale
like qualities. Another notable forms are for example old mag, and female mag, wherein mag lived as a woman. The less
the shapeshifted form resembles the original one, the more costly it is to keep up this look and the less water clones
can be employed.

Water clones are usually utilized to allow mag to be effectively at more places at once and to do tasks that require
manual labor. Many of the systems built up by mag and others require regular upkeep or constant supervision. To make
sure things are balanced, the clones and the real mag take shifts doing these tasks. This is more of a mental trick,
as all clones are one mind. Sometimes, a clone can get disconnected from the hive-mind, which leads to the copy of the
brain the clone turning on and the clone gaining sentience. These are called stray mags, it is customary for them to
change their name and looks and live out their remaining days in peace, since the amount of energy and the constitution
of the body of the clone is severely limited, only lasting decades at most.

Another important aspect are manifestations of mag. During time of extreme stress, physical and mental trauma, or a period
of time in which mags behavior was significantly out of his ordinary (regardless of whether it was more positive or negative),
a new personality, a mind-within-mind can be born. Piggy-backing of mag's abilities, they eventually gain the ability to
manifest their own body for themselves and become semi-independent. If a manifestation becomes older and powerful enough,
it can become independent to such a degree that it survives even after mag's death, as was the case with Jester, for
example. Jester was the first personality to manifest, in this case from severe physical and mental trauma suffered when
magnusi was captured, bound and used for his blood for about 200 years. Jester looks like a young man in his late twenties
with wilder and high-volume black hair, a beard, purple triangular eyes and usually a rather fierce and energetic expression.
Jester's oddity is that he does not have the concept of negative emotion and his job is to kill off other malignant
personalities and to run errands which require finesse and stealth. He usually wears social shoes, suit pants with suspenders,
a white shirt and sometimes a vest on top (pants are without suspenders in that case). Another important manifestations
include Space-time Cartographer, a middle-aged scholarly looking man who records and organizes all events surrounding
magnusi and his interests, Mr. Betwixt, who travels the Backrooms to visit people who are facing an important change in
their life to give them a blessing in return for a near imperceptible bit of the energy of happiness (what he calls a
'future investment') and looks like a kindly glasses wearing Wallstreet business man and generally speaks in business
and financial terms with a very outgoing personality, Djura, a victorian era bloodborne-esque hunter who serves as a
retainer of the old rotting wood mansion, where mag rests and rots for many years in a catatonic state after the death of an
dear person, and manifestations based on his names and positions in different mythologies of the history.

mag's blood, as stated previously is both an extremely effective cure, which in larger amounts at once also grants
echoes of mag's abilities, but it is also toxic in the sense that continued use and larger doses start to introduce
both physical and mental traits of mag and overwriting parts of the users own self. This is a precaution to make sure
the abilities of mag are not used in a way that goes against his ideals and values. However, the process usually
introduces insanity in its users, due to sometimes conflicting traits clashing with each other, and generally does not
end well for the user or their immediate vicinity. The toxicity of the blood is something mag has no control over. At
one point, a government has surreptitiously acquired substantially large amounts of blood and injected it into a coma
patient, thus creating a person who would be later known as "man-made mag" or mmm, for short. This man is weaker in his
abilities, lacks skill, experience and majority of his memories. He looks like a much more healthy person with a slightly
darker tone of skin, does not wear a hat, has a normal build instead of skinny and his trench-coat features brown accents
and has buttons. mag's blood also works as a disinfectant, drawing 'unnatural' substances out of whatever is soaked in it.

There is no such thing as really supernatural abilities that would break the law of physics and as such, mag and others
have to abide by them, which generally means that things cost exorbitant amounts of energy, a significant amount of which
is converted into heat. To accommodate for the extreme amounts of heats produced by everybody with this type of powers, dozens
of large cubes are dispersed in space towards which heat is channeled by the users. Light deities, who can gain energy by
absorbing heat reduce the amount of heat stored in the cubes by sapping it. While this does not create an equilibrium,
it counter-weighs the production of heat at least a bit. Time dilation also isn't free and all time has to be accounted for.
To make use of slowed down time for self, one later has to pay with sped up time, no debt can exist forever. As such,
most like mag generally exist within a slightly slowed down time (i.e. others appear faster to them), so that they have
a modicum of 'credit' they can use to slow down time for selves and objects when necessary. The 'debt' also accounts for
the amount of matter proportionately, for example if one spends 4 hours in 1.5x slowed down time, they can make an object
with twice the mass be 1.5x slowed down for 2 hours only, or they can slow it 3x for an hour. Time is counted by as if
a stopwatch/clock was placed into the affected area.

Speaking of stopwatches and clocks, mag generally carries a golden parachronal stopwatch. Parachronal stopwatches are
devices manufactured by the late being Chronos, who had a never before seen affinity towards time and its passage. As
a bit of a Damocles' sword type of gift, Chronos entrusted a box of these nearly indestructible devices to mag shortly
before passing away. A parachronal stopwatch has the ability to find and mark the next life-changing event in the future
of the person to whom the watch belongs. On the inside, a quote is engraved into the metal, which will shape the future
of the person owning the watch. By being notified of upcoming life-changing events (despite lacking the knowledge of
what the event is), one is able to "brace for impact" or get into a more safer spot, be more vigilant and responsible.
The event will still come, but only by virtue of knowing of its arrival, one is able to make these events less horrific,
or have a different outcome than they originally would have, which makes parachronal watches a highly sought-after
accessory. This is in contrast to a polychronal watch, which is a fabled, unfinished and possibly lost device which Chronos
was unable to finish. A polychronal watch would show all of the life-changing events, not just the nearest one, and would
also explain and contain details about it, essentially granting its user limited power over fate. Many have tried
searching for a polychronal watch, but to no avail. mag briefly investigated it as well with the goal of destroying it,
should it exist.

mag is accompanied by a sword, generally known as sword. It is a long slightly curved blade with a black edge, that
slightly resembles a katana, except for several notable in differences in balance, flexibility, shape, weight and the
fact that it predates this weaponry. The blade is sentient, holding inside the current female aspect of mag and being
able to transform into a humanoid form of a naked female. The female aspect generally refuses clothes and initially
acts in a very absent, robot-like manner, until it eventually matures, separates from the swords, becomes more human
in behavior and starts wearing clothes. The cycle repeats indefinitely. The sword is extremely heavy and very long,
however, the inner machinery and spacial dilation reduce the apparent size to regular proportions. At the cost of
mags energy, the sword is however easy to lift and wield. Its body is made of a super-heavy yet undiscovered element
from the hypothetical island of stable elements with high proton numbers and it is extremely durable and inflexible.
That makes it unwieldy for most, as flexibility is an important aspect of a weapon, but it allows it to be an efficient
cutting tool.

The rest of mags general attire consists of a long thick black trench-coat with a collar that is not too tall has no
buttons. The coat is accompanied with non-descript black narrow pants and black light shoes, a black shirt and thick black
fabric wrapped around the torso in a several layers of "V" shape, thus forming a  makeshift vest that has two ends dangling
of mags back. The final part of standard attire is a black wide-brim fedora, which mag uses to block out the sun, which
hurts his eyes after an incident where he was many years ago thrown into the sun to burn to death. While the murder attempt
was unsuccessful, it had a lasting result in form of this. However, there is no biological reason for the eyes to be that
sensitive to the sun, hinting that the issue is mostly psychosomatic.

mag likes exchanging information, deep conversations and fun fights where lives are not at stake. He uses ploys and
shapeshifting to sate these desires and intentionally cripples himself in fights for the last of the three, as stated
before. His abilities often come into play to transform what would have been a lethal confrontation into a non-lethal
one, or to discredit the seriousness of one. When swords used to be the primary weapons to be encountered, mag would
often have opponents trying to kill him come at him again and again whilst trying to improve their technique. Usually,
the other party would be exhausted or realize there is really no sense to going after mag and just leave him be.

Stoicism, feelings of nostalgia, loneliness and isolation are common themes for mag. Combat ability and heroic acts do
not matter much in mag stories, as his main goal is to study and understand the human nature, discover and understand the
purest, yet most down-to-earth form of love, build up profound relationships and understand the world a bit more. magnusi
is never okay with superficial explanations of views on various topics and it is in his nature to dig deeper and try to
have the most level-headed approach possible. magnusi has a general disregard for authority, instead preferring to treat
others informally and as his equals. This does not mean he does not listen or does the opposite things out of spite, but
that any request given must pass his values and reasoning. While trying not to interfere on a large scale, mag is partial
towards people who are fighting for a just cause, whether personal or general, who are stacked up against nearly impossible
odds and who show good heart. This is contrasted by a general dislike towards vile, conniving, corrupt, dishonest, and
morally weak people, whom, should they prove to be actively detrimental, mag likes to either have themselves talk into a
corner or do actions that expose their corruption. Of his enemies, mag is only comfortable using lethal force against
completely morally bankrupt characters or mindless monsters. He also does not like people who are irresponsible, liars,
do not feel personally accountable for their actions, mistreat people around themselves, or set being harmless as a life
goal (a good person is someone who has full capacity to do evil but elects not to do it, rather than someone who does not
do evil deeds because they lack the option or power).

mag himself is by no means good, standing as a morally grey character with an code of ethics at best. He is noted for
being a bit of a prick, general laziness and procrastination, informal or even rude speech, 'stabbing' people with his
eyes, and randomly leaving his things behind.

Standing witness to most of his peers dying or being murdered and the human acts committing atrocities over millennia,
mag is haunted by ghosts of the past, often drifting off into memories or recalling old experiences. This has also led
to him being more reclusive than he originally would have and avoiding drawing attention to people around him due to
worry that something might happen to them.

On a lighter note, mag is a prankster and a schemer, who appreciates funny and bizarre situations and revels in confusing
people. The pranks and schemes he sets up are generally, elaborate, harmless and may bring benefit to their target. mag is
a schemer outside of fun as well, making large plots which generally have positive goals. Due to a general disregard for
his physical safety (as opposed to the safety of others in general), many schemes often unintentionally lead to mag being
badly beaten or injured. However, so long as he has the energy to heal he survives.

mag hopes that one day, he and the people he likes will be able to find their own, personal, outer heaven, which is,
rather than a place, a state of being the result of a hard work and of a philosophy, and peace.
