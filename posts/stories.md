# future past murder idk

A man with time-traveling capabilities spots his future murder out of the corner of his eye, and
as he does that, he manages to temporarily project a body two weeks into the future. He learns about his murder
as a fact, but to be able to prevent it by taking the right action in the last few moments he has before
the murder, he has to figure out who the murderer was, how and why they murdered him and what all was
going on at the time of his murder.

However, as he is dead, and as it is obvious someone is after him, he has stay undercover at all
times and has to be very stealthy about what he is doing. Unfortunately, the police department has,
despite best efforts, little insight into what went on that day, and so the time-traveler has to
do some detective work himself.

Over the course of the story, he discovers clues and pieces together informations and begins to create
a picture of just how huge a thing he got accidentally involved him prior to his murder. In the
process, he also learns a lot about himself, how the people around him truly perceived him, and how
people reacted to his death.

He ponders death and considers his venture as a sort of look into the afterlife, what would be the
world like if he died. In one part of the story, he considers giving up and submitting to his fate,
as he sees that his death had a good effect on some of the people he knows, and brought about
reconciliations that before seemed impossible.

But other than that, no spoilers, hush.

# astronaut

An astronaut returns from a mission in an escape pod, but when she lands, everyone is suspicious
of her. This is because the ship was attacked by an alien that is known to have the power to shapeshift
into objects and even living things like plants or small animals, so who is to say it cannot shapeshift
into a human?

The audio logs do not sound too good for the astronaut. It shows her being attacked and her fate is not
clear, although she protests her innocence.

She is the subjected to a barrage of psychological, knowledge and ability tests to determine, whether
she is the evil imposter or not. However, everything seems to be normal, and she passes every test
with flying colors. Just a healthy, astronaut trained youthful female.

Still, the astronaut becomes extremely alienated. Neither her friends, her coworkers, her family,
or even her fioncé trust her and fully believe that she is not a dangerous malevolent alient
pretender.

After national television decides to slander her in broadcast and suggest that with such a high
probability that she is an alien she should not be allowed to move freely and instead arrested
and watched in a laboratory, she accepts an offer for an interview.

In the interview, she suffers and absolute breakdown and screams at people for making her life
absolute hell, completely disregarding that many of the people she considered to be friends died
while on the space mission, and the terrible social condition she is now in. After she just starts
sobbing uncontrollably instead of reacting to the interviewer, the broadcast is cut short and
she goes home.

Although there are nay-sayers who claim that this breakdown was a tactic employed by the malevolent
alien to get the population to lower their guard down, a voice of reason starts appearing within
the public, who suggest that it might be better to lay off her and let her be.

However, seeds of doubt has been planted within the astronaut, and she starts having phobias,
fears and anxiety about everything that could constitute as 'alien-looking', with the deepest
darkest question in her mind being: "What if she actually is the evil alien?"

This mental state leads to her being a shut-in and spending a lot of her days closed up in her
room, isolated even from her fiancé. She is absolutely socially and psychologically paralyzed,
and stuck in a loop of fears and anxieties.

At one point, she briefly entertains the idea that maybe everybody else around her is the alien,
and that this is a sick game they are playing with her to torture her, and that they will
eventually just probably kill her and eat her.

After some time of this going on, the fiancé decides that there is no way forward like this and
decides to stop being a little bitchboi and start acting like a responsible adult, and not a piece
of shit who lets problems grow to big and then yeets themself out of a relationship when they become
untenable, so he just barges in to her room to hug her, kiss her and restate his love. Possibly
also rings favorite food.

The astronaut is moved by the gesture greatly and decides that it is a good time to rehabilitate,
and so, small steps at first, she starts by reentering her own household, and then reentering the
society at large.

Sometime later, when she is confident for an alone late-night shopping venture, she is jumped by
a creepy guy in a dark alley. He is a creepy, crusty, disgusting and irredeemable good for nothing,
who jumped her because he recognized her as the astronaut. The creepy man professes that he believes
that she is not, in fact, an alien, and then tries to rape her. However, she destroys the man
through alien power (either something tame like gaping maws and shapeshifting, or if I be given drinks
and motivation, I could write something really gory and disgusting, like tentacles sprouting out of
vagina, tearing off the man's penis and then sucking him back down there as a gross unbirthing act id,
or he could just be murdered by non-descript black goo, I dunno). This, however, reveals to her
that she is actually an alien.

When the alien ate and shapeshifted the astronaut, it gained all of her knowledge, memories, feelings,
skills and sentience, and essentially it became her, and it become a moral intelligent being, whereas
when it attacked the space station, it was acting purely on base instinct, having no intelligence at
all. Now it is pretty much the woman in a different, alien, yet very convincingly human, body.

The realization of this devastates the woman and she is put into a sort of a mental schism. On one hand,
she realises she is the alien, but on the other, she still feels the alien to be a foreign presence,
like it is something inside of her that she gets to rid off. And so she tries to harm herself in
an effort to 'remove the alien', but this obviously does not work, since the whole of her is
actually alien, not to mention it is under normal conditions indistinguishable from human tissue.

Eventually, she tries to commit suicide, but fails because as the alien, she has a much increased
healing factor.

After stipulations, a long reasoning and interactions with her fiancé, friends and family, she
decides that life is worth living, even like this, and vows not to hurt anyone innocent, a vow
which she will keep. She comes to terms with the fact that she is an alien and just takes it as
a part of who she is right now.

At the end, a mentally healthy astronaut decides that maybe her powers (of which there is a wide
range), could be used for good, and so she starts figuring out ways how to control and use them
at will, and for what reason.

# two lost at the sea

Two friends, a young man and a young woman travel to an old secluded farm thats owned by the man's family
to spend a few days in the nature, and exploring the wilderness around the farm. There is only
one asphalt road leading to the farm and there are two long forest paths that lead to the closest
thing resembling civilization, one leads to the river, where there is a pub and the other leads
to a small village, that's basically just the main road lined with old buildings.

Unfortunately, two days in, the country institutes a global travel ban. Everyone has to stay
where they are, and the capital city and the surroundings, where both of them are from are
put into lockdown specifically.

And so the man and the woman are stuck on the farm with no notion of for how long it will be.
So they have to work on making the one of the farm houses they picked to stay in livable. There
is no central heating, only a wooden stove in the living room and a wood boiler in the bathroom.
The kitchen stove is gas. There is electricity, but very little phone reception and the internet
isn't setup properly.

Over the course of the story, the man and woman have to work together and learn how to co-exist
for a longer period of time. They are very similar in some aspects but quite different in others,
and so they need to figure out a way to either do away with what is undesirable or, for the differences
where neither one of them is in the "wrong" to accept and integrate them so that they do not drive
each other mad.

After some time trying, the man manages to reconnect to the internet, and so the two of them are
able to regain some social contact with the world by being able to communicate with their friends.
Meanwhile, they are combating the elements and the age of some of the things in the farm. They
have to go through some hurdless to get things working to a satisfactory level, they have to clear
a lot of things, organize and discover what is at their disposal. They are not just doing this
to the farm, but to each other as well.

Eventually, the restrictions are lifted from deliveries, so they can get some basic stuff delivered
to them, although money is obviously short at first, until they figure out that they can each do
little jobs over the internet in their respective fields to earn a little money. But still, it is
only a little money, and neither of them was particularly (maybe one of them perma-broke, and the other
slow high-earner (not getting paid that often, but it is a bigger amount), slow spender?), so they
have to figure out how to budget for food and for other things they need.

When the wolf is from the door, so to speak, a way is opened for more high-level issues and things
to consider. One of them is boredom and how to deal with it. Eventually, they figure out that something
new they can do know is transfer skills, the woman teaches the man some of the things she can do, and
so does the man. They also both pick up new, more nature-bound hobbies, for example gardening,
mushroom-picking (weather-bound), cooking (one of them kind of knows how to cook, the other only barely,
so they more knowledgeable one teaches the dumbass but also they are both learning), wood-working,
maybe sculpting out of clay?? (it is a clay-y area), and so on. Some of it will be nice and useful,
some of it funny. Of course, there would have been skills required right at the beginning too, like
chopping wood, and so on.

Of course, there will also be non-nature skills, like art, technology, sciences, engineering (they
will create some things to ease their lives) that they will help develop in each other as well.

One day inevitably comes the time where the lockdown will cause a crisis between them, or perhaps two,
one after the other. This will be the time that the deepening of their bond and knowledge of the other
in combination with the stresses of their world will cause old, previously supressed dark stuff to
come out. And so, maybe the man will have to confront and manage the darkest most vile part, i.e. the shadow,
of the woman, and the stress of doing that will make the darkest dregs of his soul return with a vengeance,
and the woman, having now integrated her old trauma will have to deal with the man, or the other way around,
i. e. the man cracks first, I dunno.

Throughout the entire course of the story, when there is not much to say and after dark falls, which, as all
know, is the time where the most profound conversations come in to being, the two of them share stories
and anecdotes from their personal histories, which slowly reveal their lives and experiences to the other person.
At first, the stories are funny, and superficial. Then, they become profound and heartfelt, and eventually,
they will for a time (occassionally) go into the trauma-zona. One of them will learn how deep can trauma go,
whereas the other will find out that others have been through serious trauma too, and will help the other
one recognize their own and deal with it.

After a long time of being at the farm, they will learn that to coexist with each other the best thing
they can do is be honest and speak the truth, even if it may produce conflict and first. And although
they learn to understand each other without the need to say some things, they will also learn that for
peace and happy coexistence, that it is important to say things. Like, whenever someoone does something
you would like them to do more of, you tell them that that was really good, and mean it. Like "I am so
glad you did that". If the one of them does something the other does not like, they say it, and if there
is argument necessary, they learn to argue at the lowest possible level of resolution, i.e. just about
the thing at hand, not bringing into it other unrelated issues. And after an even longer time, they will
notice that there exist less and less problems between them, and that the conflicts are more trivial.

The farm itself proves to be more than a background as well, and there are some hints that the farm
itself might be sentient. Or is it higher power? Just random coincidences? Ghosts? Who knows. Anyways,
it seems that when there exists harmony, the farm feels like a nice place and reveals positive/cool/
useful secrets, whereas when there is discord, it feels unwelcoming and random things break, much to
everyone's annoyance.

Meanwhile, the outside world is crumbling apart. There are great social tensions, people are at each
others' throats, there are economic impacts, a difficult political situation, increase in crime rates,
and general uncertainty present in the populace. The government is incapable of keeping at bay that
which caused this situation in the first place, and the police is not much help at keeping order either,
requiring the presence of army in large cities.

Confrontation with these news is kind of strange, since both of their families are okay and doing well,
and they are so far removed from the society and what is actually going on that it feels very surreal/
unreal to them.

One day, the farm is attacked by a burglar. Due to sheer chance, one of the two will confront the
burglar and after a fight manage to get rid of him. Unfortunately, the event becomes traumatic for
the other person (who was only a partial distant witness), and they develop stress and anxiety,
which need to be dealt with.

Displays and descriptions of nature and greenery are very important for the story, especially the
forest which encloses the farm from nearly all sides. Another aspect would be dreams, the man
dreams nostalgically about the people that he used to meet as a child at the farm and the things he
did there, whereas the woman has more abstract dreams which contain anxiety about the future.

Ending pending, but should be a more happy and meaningful one.

# the last knight on earth

A different, powered time-traveler travels into the very far future to discover it is completely in ruins,
and apparently has been like that for a very long time, with no indications as to what caused it. The man
cautiously explores the place and eventually just start pondering on the condition of man.

There is something gnawing at the heart of the man which introduces angst and seemingly improbable questions:
"What if I caused this?", "What if I was involved in the events that caused it?", "What if I could have stopped
this and I didn't?", "Is this place a testament to some evil that exists within me?" It is curious that he
thinks that, even though there is nothing to indicate that.

The time-traveler returns to this place several times, each time observing a different place, but usually at
the seashore, which is a place he particularly enjoys.

One day, he spots a man, the man is old and kind of strange but there is something about him that indicates,
nay, screams into everybody's mind that "this man is a knight". And the two meet and converse on several
occasions,

The Last Knight for some reason still keeps up his guard duties and does his watch hours, tends to the things
he was supposed to do and keeps up a regime that was created by and dependent on a world that no longer exists.

Most of the story is conversations and little symbolic gestures with the two. They discuss the world, morality,
but mainly the events which created this situation in the first place. The Last Knight knows far more than he
lets on, but he contests that this is not the time to just spill the beans. The time-traveler also suspects that
the old man is lonely, and so keeps secrets so that he would keep coming back into this time.

Eventually, it seems like there is no resolution, and the man have a, unbeknownst to them, last conversation,
about war and the endless zealous search for one's satisfactory personal "truth", and that perhaps the man's
search for what caused this is futile.

The moment the man agrees, and starts believing it, everything disappears and the time-traveler is returned
to his time. He is very confused as to what happened, but notices that the time anchor he put up in that
future is gone, meaning that future disappeared.

He travels there anyone and finds many thriving countries. In one of them, The Last Knight is discovered as
the king, but when the time-traveler gets closer to him, he finds out he is nowhere as nice, friendly an
profound as he used to be in the old time, and is in fact quite a mean authoritarian king, who is only a few
steps apart from a totalitarian regime.

The traveler is confused by this, but eventually, he figures that there is nothing he can do, and that
maybe that was the only way forward and so he comes home, and tries to make some satisfaction in the
fact that he prolonged the human existance for thousands more years at least.
