# future past murder idk

A man with time-traveling capabilities spots his future murder out of the corner of his eye, and
as he does that, he manages to temporarily project a body two weeks into the future. He learns about his murder
as a fact, but to be able to prevent it by taking the right action in the last few moments he has before
the murder, he has to figure out who the murderer was, how and why they murdered him, and what all was
going on at the time of his murder.

However, as he is dead, and as it is obvious someone is after him, he has to stay undercover at all
times and has to be very stealthy about what he is doing. Unfortunately, the police department has,
despite best efforts, little insight into what went on that day, and so the time-traveler has to
do some detective work himself.

Throughout the story, he discovers clues and pieces together information and begins to create
a picture of just how huge a thing he got accidentally involved him prior to his murder. In the
process, he also learns a lot about himself, how the people around him truly perceived him, and how
people reacted to his death.

He ponders death and considers his venture as a sort of look into the afterlife, what would be the
world like if he died. In one part of the story, he considers giving up and submitting to his fate,
as he sees that his death had a good effect on some of the people he knows, and brought about
reconciliations that before seemed impossible.

But other than that, no spoilers, hush.

# astronaut

An astronaut returns from a mission in an escape pod, but when she lands, everyone is suspicious
of her. This is because the ship was attacked by an alien that is known to have the power to shapeshift
into objects and even living things like plants or small animals, so who is to say it cannot shapeshift
into a human?

The audio logs do not sound too good for the astronaut. It shows her being attacked and her fate is not
clear, although she protests her innocence.

She is then subjected to a barrage of psychological, knowledge, and ability tests to determine, whether
she is the evil imposter or not. However, everything seems to be normal, and she passes every test
with flying colors. Just a healthy, astronaut trained youthful female.

Still, the astronaut becomes extremely alienated. Neither her friends, her coworkers, her family,
or even her fioncé trust her and fully believe that she is not a dangerous malevolent alien
pretender.

After national television decides to slander her in broadcast and suggest that with such a high
probability that she is an alien she should not be allowed to move freely and instead arrested
and watched in a laboratory, she accepts an offer for an interview.

In the interview, she suffers an absolute breakdown and screams at people for making her life
absolute hell, completely disregarding that many of the people she considered to be friends died
while on the space mission, and the terrible social condition she is now in. After she just starts
sobbing uncontrollably instead of reacting to the interviewer, the broadcast is cut short and
she goes home.

Although there are nay-sayers who claim that this breakdown was a tactic employed by the malevolent
alien to get the population to lower their guard down, a voice of reason starts appearing within
the public, who suggests that it might be better to lay off her and let her be.

However, seeds of doubt have been planted within the astronaut, and she starts having phobias,
fears and anxiety about everything that could constitute as 'alien-looking', with the deepest
darkest question in her mind being: "What if she is the evil alien?"

This mental state leads to her being a shut-in and spending a lot of her days closed up in her
room, isolated even from her fiancé. She is absolutely socially and psychologically paralyzed,
and stuck in a loop of fears and anxieties.

At one point, she briefly entertains the idea that maybe everybody else around her is the alien,
and that this is a sick game they are playing with her to torture her, and that they will
eventually just probably kill her and eat her.

After some time of this going on, the fiancé decides that there is no way forward like this and
decides to stop being a little bitchboi and start acting like a responsible adult, and not a piece
of shit who lets problems grow too big and then yeets themself out of a relationship when they become
untenable, so he just barges into her room to hug her, kiss her and restate his love. Possibly
also rings favorite food.

The astronaut is moved by the gesture greatly and decides that it is a good time to rehabilitate,
and so, small steps at first, she starts by reentering her household, and then re-entering the
society at large.

Sometime later, when she is confident for an alone late-night shopping venture, she is jumped by
a creepy guy in a dark alley. He is a creepy, crusty, disgusting, and irredeemable good for nothing,
who jumped her because he recognized her as the astronaut. The creepy man professes that he believes
that she is not, in fact, an alien, and then tries to rape her. However, she destroys the man
through alien power (either something tame like gaping maws and shapeshifting, or if I am given drinks
and motivation, I could write something gory and disgusting, like tentacles sprouting out of
her vagina, tearing off the man's penis and then sucking him back down there as a gross unbirthing act id,
or he could just be murdered by non-descript black goo, I dunno). This, however, reveals to her
that she is the alien.

When the alien ate and shapeshifted into the astronaut, it gained all of her knowledge, memories, feelings,
skills, and sentience, and essentially it became her, and it became a moral intelligent being, whereas
when it attacked the space station, it was acting purely on base instinct, having no intelligence at
all. Now it is pretty much the woman in a different, alien, yet very convincingly human, body.

The realization of this devastates the woman and she is put into a sort of a mental schism. On one hand,
she realizes she is the alien, but on the other, she still feels the alien to be a foreign presence,
like it is something inside of her that she gets to rid of. And so she tries to harm herself in
an effort to 'remove the alien', but this does not work, since the whole of her is
the alien, not to mention it is under normal conditions indistinguishable from human tissue.

Eventually, she tries to commit suicide but fails because as the alien, she has a much increased
healing factor.

After stipulations, long reasoning, and interactions with her fiancé, friends, and family, she
decides that life is worth living, even like this, and vows not to hurt anyone innocent, a vow
which she will keep. She comes to terms with the fact that she is an alien and just takes it as
a part of who she is right now.

In the end, a mentally healthy astronaut decides that maybe her powers (of which there is a wide
range), could be used for good, and so she starts figuring out ways how to control and use them
at will, and for what reason.

# at thy twilight, old thoughts return, in great waves of nostalgia

The two doctors are friends. One of them is a stereotypical white old man, whereas the other is
a black gentleman. The white one has retired already, and the black one is very old as well.

Since his retirement, the white one struggles to figure out what to do with his life. He has
a family, but they are all grown up or abroad, so he can enjoy them only occasionally, he tries
several hobbies, but nothing fits, and so what he does is he visits his black friend in the
hospital.

Originally, they were a group of friend doctors, there was about a dozen of them at this
hospital, men and women, but now, it is only the black left, and the white coming to visit him.
The others have either died or retired and disappeared from the 'public eye' of the hospital.

Every time he visits, they both have a pleasant conversation, talking about life, interest,
interesting medical cases, what are the young doctors like, and also sometimes reminiscing
about the old times, and the people that they used to know who worked at the hospital, and
so on.

After a few visits, the black reluctantly divulges that he will be retiring soon too, that
he has some health issued and that he cannot manage the difficult hospital work for that
much longer. He states to white that he could use a golf partner.

White then starts crying, and so does black. It is because inside they know, that with this,
their world is over, and the longest chapter of their lives is ending, and now, all that
they have had over the years will become just memories. Perhaps, it was time to go now.

They realize that the world around them has changed and soared somewhere else, but they,
in their old age, cannot keep up, and so inevitably, some things must come to an end.

The black, having a very similar familial situation, then retires and together with white,
they buy a plot in the countryside near the city. And together, with the help of hired
workers, they start building a house for the two of them, which they eventually succeed
in completing.

The story ends with the two old friends living together in the house and going for a
game of golf.

# bulgakov

A strange man with a taste of theatrics, peculiar fashion sense, a beret, differently
colored eyes and a talking cat visit Mikhail Bulgakov at his home, completely disregarding
anything Bulgakov might have planned to do that day and just pretty much inviting themselves
in.

The man introduces himself with a number of contradicting titles, stating that he is an
artist, and that he is a performer, and that he is a government official, and that he is a
professor, and that he is just a simple man, and that he is of nobility, and so on, whereas the
cat just says it is a talking cat.

Bulgakov quite surprised at what's going on, especially the cat, drops in his mind any plans
he might have had for that day and decides to sit the uninvited guests down.

The man claims that as a writer (yet another claimed profession) he is interested in Bulgakov's
works, and mentions his favorite ones, some of which Bulgakov hasn't published or even has no
knowledge of.

Bulgakov then rightly asks, that while he is flattered that he and the cat (who just lets out
sarcastic remarks at random moments) consider his work good, that he would still like to know
why they are here.

The man then tells him that he is there to talk about God and the Devil. He challenges the image
of God as just a good, merciful benevolent force and the Devil as the personification of evil.
Bulgakov and the man, with occasional input from the cat, then discuss that while the Devil is
an undeniable agent of chaos and he some anti-heroic/anti-villainous properties, there is no reason,
and, perhaps there should not be a reason, for him to be evil.

That Devil and the temptation are forces from the area of chaos that are working to expose the
evil that is present in men, that the excuse of 'satan made me do it', or 'satan is responsible'
are moot because all that Satan does is expose and present to the world, and perhaps to the target
themselves the evil that is present within.

They then go back to the image of Satan in the Old Testament, taking into account that Satan means
the Accuser, and that is perhaps to a degree the Devil's job. To expose, and to accuse. The two
then discuss the predicament of the Devil himself, his original position, his transgression, and
his rebellion and his being cast out of heaven. And, in relation to this, if it is possible that
he has done enough penance and that maybe his punishment was harsh. After all, a part of Lucifer's
motivation was love, and is love really something that should be punished harshly?

Bulgakov then concludes that maybe the reason the Devil now stays confined to Hell
and to the mortal realm (i.e. anywhere but Heaven) is maybe not because he wants to escape but
cannot, but because he accepts his difficult job out of love for God, and therefore has not thought
much of escaping and perhaps besieging Heaven again so he could get in once more. The cat calls
this bullshit.

Once they have finished drinking their tea, the man invites Bulgakov to step outside and follow
him for a bit. On the way, they discuss the rot in the hearts of men and if it is possible for an
entire society to become corrupt, given the correct conditions. And the role that desperation
and manipulation from above perhaps play in that.

They eventually reach a very busy street and the man tells Bulgakov to watch. He loudly yells
"Behold!" which grabs the attention of the people nearby and takes out a large pouch full of coins
and bills and swings it out to cover the entire length of the street with many. The people then
go crazy trying to grab as many coins and bills as they can, even fighting and punching each other
and stealing the money from one another. When a sleazy man pulls out a gun at a pregnant woman who
picked up more money than he did, he immediately turns into a pillar of salt.

Bulgakov, who has not picked up any money and just watched what was happening is completely
astonished. When he snaps out of it, he tries turning and calling the man but he realizes that
both the man and the cat are nowhere to be found, having seemingly vanis

# two lost at the sea

Two friends, a young man and a young woman travel to an old secluded farm that's owned by the man's family
to spend a few days in nature, and exploring the wilderness around the farm. There is only
one asphalt road leading to the farm and two long forest paths lead to the closest
thing resembling civilization, one leads to the river, where there is a pub, and the other leads
to a small village, that's pretty much just the main road lined with old buildings.

Unfortunately, two days in, the country institutes a global travel ban. Everyone has to stay
where they are, and the capital city and the surroundings, where both of them are from are
put into lockdown specifically.

And so the man and the woman are stuck on the farm with no notion of for how long it will be.
So they have to work on making one of the farm houses they picked to stay in livable. There
is no central heating, only a wooden stove in the living room, and a wood boiler in the bathroom.
The kitchen stove is gas. There is electricity, but very little phone reception and the internet
isn't set up properly.

Throughout the story, the man and woman have to work together and learn how to co-exist
for a longer period of time. They are very similar in some aspects but quite different in others,
and so they need to figure out a way to either do away with what is undesirable or, for the differences
where neither one of them is in the "wrong" to accept and integrate them so that they do not drive
each other mad.

After some time trying, the man manages to reconnect to the internet, and so the two of them can regain
some social contact with the world by being able to communicate with their friends.
Meanwhile, they are combating the elements and the age of some of the things on the farm. They
have to go through some hurdles to get things working to a satisfactory level, they have to clear
a lot of things, organize and discover what is at their disposal. They are not just doing this
to the farm, but to each other as well.

Eventually, the restrictions are lifted from deliveries, so they can get some basic stuff delivered
to them, although money is short at first until they figure out that they can each do
little jobs over the internet in their respective fields to earn a little money. But still, it is
only a little money and neither of them was particularly (maybe one of them perma-broke, and the other
slow high-earner (not getting paid that often, but it is a bigger amount), slow spender?), so they
have to figure out how to budget for food and for other things they need.

When the wolf is from the door, so to speak, a way is opened for more high-level issues and things
to consider. One of them is boredom and how to deal with it. Eventually, they figure out that something
new they can do know is transfer skills, the woman teaches the man some of the things she can do, and
so does the man. They also both pick up new, more nature-bound hobbies, for example gardening,
mushroom-picking (weather-bound), cooking (one of them kind of knows how to cook, the other only barely,
so they more knowledgeable one teaches the dumbass but also they are both learning), wood-working,
maybe sculpting out of clay?? (it is a clay-y area), and so on. Some of it will be nice and useful,
some of it is funny. Of course, there would have been skills required right at the beginning too, like
chopping wood, and so on.

Of course, there will also be non-nature skills, like art, technology, sciences, engineering (they
will create some things to ease their lives) that they will help develop in each other as well.

One day inevitably comes the time where the lockdown will cause a crisis between them, or perhaps two,
one after the other. This will be the time that the deepening of their bond and knowledge of the other
in combination with the stresses of their world will cause old, previously suppressed dark stuff to
come out. And so, maybe the man will have to confront and manage the darkest vilest part, i.e. the shadow,
of the woman, and the stress of doing that will make the darkest dregs of his soul return with a vengeance,
and the woman, having now integrated her old trauma will have to deal with the man, or the other way around,
i. e. the man cracks first, I dunno.

Throughout the entire course of the story, when there is not much to say and after dark falls, which, as all
know, is the time where the most profound conversations come into being, the two of them share stories
and anecdotes from their personal histories, which slowly reveal their lives and experiences to the other person.
At first, the stories are funny and superficial. Then, they become profound and heartfelt, and eventually,
they will for a time (occasionally) go into the trauma-zona. One of them will learn how deep can trauma go,
whereas the other will find out that others have been through serious trauma too, and will help the other
one recognize their own and deal with it.

After a long time of being at the farm, they will learn that to coexist with each other the best thing
they can do is be honest and speak the truth, even if it may produce conflict and first. And although
they learn to understand each other without the need to say some things, they will also learn that for
peace and happy coexistence, that it is important to say things. Like, whenever someone does something
you would like them to do more of, you tell them that that was really good, and mean it. Like "I am so
glad you did that". If one of them does something the other does not like, they say it, and if there
is an argument necessary, they learn to argue at the lowest possible level of resolution, i.e. just about
the thing at hand, not bringing into it other unrelated issues. And after an even longer time, they will
notice that there exist fewer and fewer problems between them and that the conflicts are more trivial.

The farm itself proves to be more than a background as well, and there are some hints that the farm
itself might be sentient. Or is it higher power? Just random coincidences? Ghosts? Who knows. Anyways,
it seems that when there exists harmony, the farm feels like a nice place and reveals positive/cool/
useful secrets, whereas when there is discord, it feels unwelcoming and random things break, much to
everyone's annoyance.

Meanwhile, the outside world is crumbling apart. There are great social tensions, people are at each
others' throats, there are economic impacts, a difficult political situation, increase in crime rates,
and general uncertainty present in the populace. The government is incapable of keeping at bay that
which caused this situation in the first place, and the police is not much help at keeping order either,
requiring the presence of the army in large cities.

Confrontation with these news is kind of strange since both of their families are okay and doing well,
and they are so far removed from the society and what is going on that it feels very surreal/
unreal to them.

One day, the farm is attacked by a burglar. Due to sheer chance, one of the two will confront the
burglar and after a fight manages to get rid of him. Unfortunately, the event becomes traumatic for
the other person (who was only a partial distant witness), and they develop stress and anxiety,
which need to be dealt with.

Displays and descriptions of nature and greenery are very important for the story, especially the
forest which encloses the farm from nearly all sides. Another aspect would be dreams, the man
dreams nostalgically about the people that he used to meet as a child at the farm and the things he
did there, whereas the woman has more abstract dreams which contain anxiety about the future.

Ending pending, but should be a more happy and meaningful one.

# the last knight on earth

A different, powered time-traveler travels into the very far future to discover it is completely in ruins,
and apparently has been like that for a very long time, with no indications as to what caused it. The man
cautiously explores the place and eventually just start pondering on the condition of man.

Something is gnawing at the heart of the man which introduces angst and seemingly improbable questions:
"What if I caused this?", "What if I was involved in the events that caused it?", "What if I could have stopped
this and I didn't?", "Is this place a testament to some evil that exists within me?" It is curious that he
thinks that, even though there is nothing to indicate that.

The time-traveler returns to this place several times, each time observing a different place, but usually at
the seashore, which is a place he particularly enjoys.

One day, he spots a man, the man is old and kind of strange but there is something about him that indicates,
nay, screams into everybody's mind that "this man is a knight". And the two meet and converse on several
occasions,

The Last Knight for some reason still keeps up his guard duties and does his watch hours, tends to the things
he was supposed to do and keeps up a regime that was created by and dependent on a world that no longer exists.

Most of the story is conversations and little symbolic gestures with the two. They discuss the world, morality,
but mainly the events which created this situation in the first place. The Last Knight knows far more than he
lets on, but he contests that this is not the time to just spill the beans. The time-traveler also suspects that
the old man is lonely, and so keeps secrets so that he would keep coming back into this time.

Eventually, it seems like there is no resolution, and the two men have a, unbeknownst to them, last conversation,
about war and the endless zealous search for one's satisfactory personal "truth", and that perhaps the man's
search for what caused this is futile.

The moment the man agrees and starts believing it, everything disappears and the time-traveler is returned
to his time. He is very confused as to what happened, but notices that the time anchor he put up in that
future is gone, meaning that the future disappeared.

He travels there anyone and finds many thriving countries. In one of them, The Last Knight is discovered as
the king, but when the time-traveler gets closer to him, he finds out he is nowhere as nice, friendly an
profound as he used to be in the old time, and is, in fact, quite a mean authoritarian king, who is only a few
steps apart from a totalitarian regime.

The traveler is confused by this, but eventually, he figures that there is nothing he can do and perhaps nothing
that he should do, and that maybe that was the only way forward and so he comes home and tries to take some
satisfaction in the fact that he prolonged the human existence significantly.

# tiny nazi Franz

Franz is a somewhat high-rank Nazi officer who got into his position more by way of complacency and allowing himself
to be pushed around, rather than being a horrible monster from the get-go.

At the beginning of the story, Franz suddenly opens his eyes in his office and realizes that he forgot absolutely
everything, including his name and who he is, and what is he doing, etc. etc. He goes to look into a mirror, and what
he sees on the other side of the glass (and after looking at his hands and body) is a twelve-year-old boy at best.

Suddenly, some other lower-ranked officers come into his office to clear some stuff, and Franz has to fake that he
knows what's going on. During this, he learns his name. He finds it strange enough that none of the men question
that he either is or at least looks like a child (but does he really?).

Throughout the story, he learns about what is going on in Germany, but because he is not indoctrinated slowly but
rather immediately thrown into the dark and gritty parts of the Nazi regime (since he lost his memory and just
immediately experiences hardcore Nazi stuff), he does not share the ideology and is horrified at what is going on.

And so several things are going on for Franz, first, he has to learn how to act not to arouse suspicion, then he thinks
that he should probably do something, since he actually seems to have a lot of power within the state, but then, he
also thinks that he is in grave danger at his position, since he may get discovered at any time and that could probably
net him a short drop and a sudden stop, if not a shooting squad. Then he also has to rediscover his connections with
other people and how he lived his life (for some time not realizing that he has a heavily indoctrinated Aryan Nazi wife).

In numerous situations, he is close to being discovered but just barely manages to bullshit his way through. At the same
time, he also wonders why no one questions the fact that he is a small kid, and finds it strange that big rough tough
Nazis listen to him.

There is also a strange divide and something that is perplexing to him, and that is that on one hand, he knows
how reprehensible and horrible the stuff the Nazis are doing is, but on the other hand, the top-rank Nazi officers seem
like such nice people and treat Franz with respect, dignity, and friendliness, inviting him for fun activities and doing
nice gestures. And so he tries to figure out how come that people like these are keeping in operation a machine that
kills thousands a day.

Throughout the story, he also gets involved with the resistance, unwittingly running into them and nearly introducing
collective heart attacks (because top-rank Nazi Franz discovered them), but then it comes to light that this Franz is
not a Nazi at all. And he is perplexed because these people are nice to him as well, although suspicious
and threatening at first. So why the hell is there so much evil? Where is it hiding?

In another venture, Rudolf Höss comes to pick him up for a dinner with The Führer. During the dinner, he has to
endure Hitler's rants and also pretend to be able of dispensing the right kind of top Nazi table talk, lest he arouses
suspicion. He finds that Hitler is a really strange person and much different than what the media portrays, on one
hand showing a clear artistic, animal-loving, and intellectual side, but on the other dispensing hateful, anti-semitic
and racist remarks that completely dehumanize 'enemies' of The Reich. And this allows Franz to make a better picture
of how it came to be, branding Hitler in his mind as a corrupt and turncoat-ish intellectual. Near the end of the
evening, Franz fucks up by being unable to remember an important fact, but Höss surprisingly does a friendly gesture
and saves him from trouble, before casually mentioning that they need to expand the corpse disposal unit at Auschwitz.

In the latter part of the story, Franz can piece together an image of German society and what is going on
with people. He divorces his absolutely corrupt and indoctrinated Nazi wife on grounds of 'not being Nazi enough',
which everyone buys, and starts a little more than friendship with a girl from the resistance.

Near the end of the story, he has collected a lot of information about the inner workings of the party and the Reich
and many state secrets, not to mention the secrets of the Nazi officials. Franz then manages to covertly sabotage a large
communications facility, which allows resistance fighters to carry out a hit at two weapons factories. Through the
resistance's help and set up through his Nazi connections, he is then able to provide a lot of weaponry for the resistance
fighters and is also able to fake his death.

Tiny Franz and the girls then covertly travel to the US where Franz contacts and joins the CIA, providing a lot of
important intel, which might be enough to turn the tide of war.

A few years later, Tiny Franz now looking like a young adult reads the memoirs and writings of Rudolf Höss, the part
where he realizes the gravity of his crimes and gives advice to other people and especially his son, how to conduct
themselves as to not fall into the same ideological pit as he did. The road to hell is paved with good
intentions and bad eyesight.
