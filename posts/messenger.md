title = "[EN/IT Rant] Messenger is a fractal of bad design"

Throwing around “fractals of bad design” is a serious offense,
since it immediately draws connection to the semi-legendary
“PHP: a fractal of bad design” post[1], which,
for all programming language design professionals and enthusiasts,
dismantled any respect PHP had as a programming language.
I think that it was a spectacular post
that heavily contributed to the professionals’ tradition of complaining about absolutely everything.

It may sound strange that I am complaining about Messenger in particular,
since my demeanor might betray my dislike for Facebook as a whole.
However, the better part of Facebook doesn’t irritate me on a technical level,
since I can just elect to ignore it. Messenger is, however, a different case.
It is the ubiquitous instant messaging platform,
mostly because of the way it is interconnected with Facebook.

However, if we compare it to other similar chatting platform,
its feature set is nowhere near impressive.
Messenger relies on having a streamlined and intuitive experience.
This comes at a tremendous cost because as a result Facebook
opted not to include some features rather than hiding them away
(which is preferable, if you strive for a streamlined experience).

Messenger does not support end-to-end encryption
(its respect of user privacy is also questionable at best),
large groups, lacks native clients,
actively fights against alternative open-source clients,
has subpar message deletion options,
makes it difficult to back up chat history and a many more issues.

I wouldn’t mind these in particular, if Messenger worked.
However, it doesn’t.
I continuously experience weird glitches regardless of browser
(thanks Messenger, I don’t need you to automatically scroll to the beginning of message history),
LaTeX and markdown support is broken/non-existant on mobile clients,
voice chat is cancer and both the web client and native mobile
applications are the definition of bloatware.
Big, slow and with a very low feature-density.

A while ago, some family friends experienced a rather bizarre issue.
Messenger would corrupt a video they were trying to send.
Every other platform would work, but when sent through messenger,
the video would cut off a few seconds in with heavy artifacting. What the hell.
Oh and there was that time last summer when images
simply did not work across the platform at all for like two days.

Then there is also the user restrictions.
I really dislike that for reactions you can utilize only a handful of emojis.
Same goes for the “chat emoji”, which is what replaces Like in a conversation,
if you set it to something.
The set of available emojis is better than for reactions,
but still severely limited.
This isn’t because Facebook’s back-end couldn’t handle it.
Through the use of some REST magic,
I manually called messenger API to set emojis in some of my chats to ones,
that would be more thematic than the basic ones, like robots or Russian flags.
And voilà, it worked perfectly. I also got a temporary ban from Facebook for doing that,
but the settings stayed, so the prize was worth the pain, so to speak.

This shows, that despite appearances, Messenger is not a user friendly platform.
There are broken features left and right, limitations up and down and extreme inflexibility in the center.
Adoption of fixes and new features is extremely slow and
if you want to take look into Facebook’s documentation to learn more about your issue,
then good luck, you will most often get a nice message that
this piece of documentation is not available in your language, so screw you.

To conclude: Messenger sucks, use Telegram
(unless you are in Russia, where it was banned for Putin stickers
and refusing to share user data with the government,
in which case use Telegram ~ but secretly ~)
