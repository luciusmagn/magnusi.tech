title = "[EN/IT Rant] Properietary software has no place in general IT education"

During the last few weeks, I had a lot more time to discuss education with
my friends from different schools and also got to experience what systems
are in place at several different institutions.

Not that I would be bored or unoccupied – quite the opposite, so far,
it was quite the opposite, I was overburdened with work for all sorts of
subjects. However, the lack of a traditional classroom allows me to discuss
freely that which interests while I am working on something that does not.

I am now convinced, more than ever, that proprietary software shouldn’t
be taught as part of general (involuntary) IT education. There are several
reasons why, so let’s break it down.

The first piece of proprietary software that one will encounter at school,
maybe even in life, is probably Microsoft Windows (if you’d like to
argue that Android, since you see toddler-age demons smashing tablets,
then remember, that Android, while backed up by an evil conglomerate, is an
open-source software).

In this day and age, M$ Windows is in no way a prevalent operating
system. Linux actually takes the lead and for a good reason – it sucks
less(tm). It is the backbone of the internet, cloud computing and undisputed
ruler of the handheld world (since aforementioned Android is actually a
Linux distribution).

Unfortunately, Windows is still an unavoidable piece of software in the
consumer sector. Therefore, I don’t mind if basic OS interfacing is taught
on Windows – the classic create/move/delete files, browse the web, send
a proper email, edit text files et al. shenanigans. What I mind, however,
is more complex OS-specific functions being taught. This creates a dependency
and throws us into the (in the IT world) everpresent danger of Plato’s cave
syndrome. “Yay, it’s so cool it can do that, Windows is the best OS”
(Because I don’t know that something better exists and I am unwilling to
broaden my horizons).

The instillment of Plato’s cave syndrome is a fundamental issue in this
matter. For instance, many people form a parasitic relationship with MS
Office (except you are the host, lol). What they don’t know, however,
is that they, for example in the case of MS Word, rarely ever utilize more
than the few most basic functions of a word processor. Use different faces,
font-sizes, justification, lists, embed images, tables, graphs. These are
all basic functions and you don’t need to fork over thousands to purchase
a MS Office license.

I am certain that it would be more beneficial to teach these using
Google Docs or Open/LibreOffice as the free and opensource alternatives,
respectively. Same goes for programs like Photoshop, Cinema 4D or <pick
a random Adobe product>. There exists a free and opensource alternative
for everything.

Going back to the operating system issue, I think it would be beneficial to
include basic Linux to the basic IT curriculum. Just to let the students
know that there exists a smarter and more frugal alternative and that
they are not actually dependent on Windows for most tasks – that these
are ubiquitous features of desktop experience on all operating systems
(I’d wager most users could live even on some distribution of FreeBSD,
imagine that!). There exists a myth among the general population that Linux
et al. are some obscure monstrosity suitable only for advanced users and IT
professionals. 30 years ago? Maybe. Today? You will probably have an easier
time installing a mainstream Linux distribution than Windows.

My second objection to teaching proprietary software in general IT education is
that it creates a sort of an invisible business contract between the company
and the students. If you raise children in a malleable age to be users of
your software, they will probably stay users in later life. And users are
customers. Customers are profit. While convincing the population to use your
software is completely valid and an important part of every business strategy,
doing this to children through schools is a little predatory. Usually, the way
it works is that you pay for marketing and a responsible (reality is debatable,
see Apple products, but in theory yes, responsible) population will evaluate
your product and decide to buy into it or not. In a school setting, no such
process is in place. The school imposes something onto you, stripping you of
choice (which, as a libertarian, grinds my gears a bit), and the company has
to pay for no marketing whatsoever. What’s better, sometimes the school
itself has to pay to provide software licenses to students! (If your school
requires you to purchase any software, change school). So you get profit,
unquestioning customers and no marketing expenses. That is what we call a
pro gamer move. (But the company we would call the latter half of the name
of this establishment).

School-provided licenses are the third reason why I am opposed to proprietary
software education. Because in essence, you create a dependency. Students will
start using the software they have been provided with and forced to use, they
will invest time into it and probably store a number of important documents,
course work and media files in proprietary formats, which are often made hard
to reverse-engineer on purpose (notice how Word documents look a bit fucked
in a plenty of word processors?). The effect of this is not immediately
obvious, just like you feel fine so long as your drug supply doesn’t run
dry. But that will eventually happen, either at the end of one’s studies
or when changing schools to one, that has a different infrastructure (and it
is virtually impossible for find a school that would have the same software
setup). What will happen is that our poor subject will go into a sort of a
withdrawal. Things will stop working as the licenses end and you are running
the risk of losing access to your own property. For the common user, there
is only one solution – fork over some cash and extend your licenses. In
today’s economy and way of life, which is particularly unkind to college
students, this is a transgression of the highest order.

The majority of the process relies on unconscious propagation. The school
doesn’t realize the effects of its actions. The teachers are unaware of the
consequences of what they are teaching and students are blissfully ignorant
of what they are subjected to.

However, I don’t condone proprietary software education completely. What
I mind is the involuntary aspect (if another professor mandates I hand in a
DOCX Word document, I’m handing in an AES encrypted Wingdings copy of the
Communist Manifesto). I fully support voluntary subjects to be available. They
may prepare you for occupations which require specific proprietary software,
or the may help you if you – yourself – make a conscious choice to
subscribe to a particular proprietary software. And that is completely
fine. But don’t push them into general, mandatory education, please.

Anyways, this has been long enough. So, to conclude, let me say this:
Properietary software in schools sucks. Thank you, bye-bye.
