_A long time ago, there lived a man. After journeying far and wide, he stopped to rest
at a great old tree. The mighty branches showed him the years, and for the first time in ages, the man
realized he was lost. And there was no home to return to._

It has been weeks since Orla last had a good nights sleep. The town of Middlefield was no longer safe.
Every few days, a body has been reported or another person disappeared. Every little sound at night was
unnerving. After a body of ne of her neighbours was found, Orla purchased herself a firearm which she
kept loaded in her nightstand during the night, and ready in her purse during the day.

It was during these days that a part of her heart yearned for the company of her ex-boyfriend and his
friends who would often come to visit, but bygones are bygones and Orla knew that very well.

Sleepless nights lead to even more unpleasant awakenings. The a≈Øarm clock did not ring today, as she
was already slowly and reluctantly climbing out of bed more than twenty minutes before the alarm was
set. These days, alarm clocks are mostly a novelty, since everyone can make use of their phone, but
this one was an heirloom, one of the few remainders she had of her late uncle, a man who was a hopeless
tinkerer at heart.

Per usual, the next destination in Orla's daily journey was the bathroom, necessitated by not only
biological needs but also a hope that perhaps a shower might freshen her up, get the blood flowing
and help her get into working order.

Work was not easy these last days. Orla was a investigative journalist, and, in what part of her now
perhaps considers a lap of judgement, she decided to take up the task of making a story on the disappearances
and murders in the town. But so far, there were no leads, and everyone she interviewed only imparted
sadness and no leads whatsoever. At least she found some solace in knowing that the police department
was equally as stuck as she was.

Orla splashed cold water onto her face, and looked in the mirror. She was a shorter and thinner woman,
rather pale, with brown eyes, a narrower but not sharp face, and hair that featured red, blonde and black
hairs. It was a genetic mutation passed down from her mothers side. Unfortunately, as intriguing as it
may sound, these colors together make a greyish brown, as if her hair was dusty. Orla had tried dying
her hair before, but in the last years, she has given up on it.
