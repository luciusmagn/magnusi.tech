*/I have forgotten even reason with tears  
My memories were frozen, and  
That season and the same wintry breeze  
Now rewinds our time/*


The crash through the surface broke my spine.
My fall slowed down and, soon enough, the waves above regained their peace.
I sunk for what felt like an eternity.

_/Misunderstandings, hesitation in the moment  
A common sentimentalism  
That forever unattainable moment/_  

When I reached the bottom, I could barely make out the sky above.
The sea bed was unexpectedly soft and the terrain around me provided shelter and comfort.


*Is this a good place to die?*

It's a little ironic, the supposed "god" of the sea drowning. But well, I guess it happens, life works in mysterious ways.
For all my years, I still haven't figured out all that much.

_/One more... Nevermore...  
Unspoken words  
Although young, although kind  
Numbed memories.../_  

I have spent eons seeing, hearing and sensing everything around me. So much, that I have forgotten to appreciate silence. And was it worth it? I can't tell, maybe I would have become a different man.

*A Stranger*

I probably wouldn't have ended up here. But those regrets are for another day - if it ever comes, that is. I knew what it would entail the moment before I made this decision.

*A Sacrifice*

I know how this future will unfold. That she won't be the great person I used to know. It was the terrible condition and the suffering what humbled her. I saw it in the eyes, like I always do.

Many people do this, they confuse a harmless person with a good person. But one has to ask a question - is this person, who I consider harmless, actually good or are they only doing good deeds because they do not have the chance or the power to be evil?

*How long can one bottle up misery?*

I thought about this for a long time and although I cannot define a good person, or even discern whether I myself am good, I can speak about this one trait of a good person. Good people aren't harmless, they are dangerous and posses the ability to harm, but they opt not to do so. That's what makes a good person.

She is going to be like that now, the first part, I mean. A harmful person, probably manipulative and vicious. A being which brings pain into hearts of many.

*Something might humble her some day*

*I hope*

Nevertheless, I did it. A deal with the universe. Can't call it a pact with the devil, if I am the latter, huh. One unchangeable moment changed.

_/The chosen taleâ€™s continuation is that  
Today, in other words,  
Is a future that is not you/_  

The price? The years we spent, the memories and all the life that was left in me. Wasn't much of it anyway.

*Was it love that made me do it?*

My left eye just gave out. It is not an issue, I won't be needing it I suppose. It's just a shame I can no longer see the surface of the water.

*The left eye looks outside, the right eye looks inside*

Oh, a crab. Come here, little friend. Must be fate, huh? Or a joke? Anyways, I'm glad to see you. Let's call you Larry. Larry the Crab.

*I think my right arm just fell off. Can't move anyway*

Anyways, Larry, what brings you here? Important crab business I suppose? Well, do stay a while. It's nice to have some company sometimes.

Do you dream, Larry? I haven't had a dream for so long. Part of me was always awake, watching over the world. It was taxing but also fascinating. Closing my eyes was not an option.

*Scenes, people, patterns, oddities, confusion*

I believe this might be a good time for a dream. Perhaps a few dreams of past, present and the future might be in place? Come with me, Larry. It's nice to have some company sometimes.

*You spend your entire life looking at things from the side, surely you must have an interesting perspective?*

I'm in a desert, a few centuries ago. Larry is cautiously discovering this new type of sand - I don't think he likes it.
I came here because one of my eyes saw something strange. A tiny nordic girl wandering through the desert.

*How do you get so lost you end up on a different continent?*

She will die of heatstroke in those "viking" clothes. Maybe even without them. Most humans aren't really built for this kind of heat. But she isn't human - I noticed it immediately - she was one of us.

I extended my aura to help her cool down, then I let her drink some water.

*Peculiar*

Caring for another child wasn't the thing for me right now, I thought. The last one was trouble enough, hmm. I brought her to the closest town and I hoped she would be taken in by the locals.

The little rascal, however, stuck to my leg like a magnet. I tried talking to her in all the nordic languages I knew.

*It took five days for her to respond*

I didn't learn anything useful. She had a name, though, so at least that.

And so I took a slight detour of fifteen years from my usual shenanigans. It's fascinating that humans are the dominant species when they are basically useless for the better part of the first two decades of their life.

I raised her and taught her how to use what lies within her. It turned out that she had a particular affinity for aurora borealis. Sensing a disturbance so high up in the atmosphere was quite a shock.

In her years with me, she became a formidable fighter and knew what to expect from the hearts of mortal men. In the end, I think she maybe understands them better than me.

*Curious*

It was winter when we parted ways. It's cold here and the snow covered the world with silence. Or that's what one might think. If you listen carefully, you'll hear the snow crack and the nature shuffle around underneath the white blanket.

*It's like when you suddenly focus on the sound of the clock that has been ticking all day*

She said she wanted to experience the world on her own. I agreed, I thought it was a good idea. Everyone should experience the world raw and unsheltered, if for a while.

*I wonder how is she doing now*

In current time, she is doing quite well I hear. She is still a warrior, I believe, only now, the battlefield is high society and the weapons aren't as honest.

*It's a good development*

I like these memories, what about you, Larry? If nothing else, you had a nice view of new lands.

*I think a fish took away my right foot*

What separates a disciple from a child?  
I had a disciple once, or more accurately several times, but this one was the first major. Maybe the most important.

*A lesson learned*

You see, crabby, these people you see on the beach every day aren't the first ones. There came people before them, advanced and civilized. A hundred thousand years ago, give or take. The first men, one could say.

Maybe it was some evolutionary oddity, or perhaps a test from a higher-power, who knows. They lived on an island in a quite secluded community. In their prime, there was a few dozen million of them.

*You could think of it as Atlantis*

They built their houses from marble and decorated them with shiny metals. A religious people, perhaps maybe because of our influence, the supposed "gods". Do you know why we don't get involved anymore? This is why.

*Death*

I used to be quite popular back then, I had cathedrals dedicated to me. I would travel the lands and do my usual stuff, pranks here, mischief there, random life lessons here, getting people shitfaced there. Like I said, the usual stuff, as a trickster god does.

I met a boy once. He was pale and slender and his eyes had this spark - I have only seen it a few times since - it was a spark of a very special kind of exceptionality, one which can make or break a world.

I took him in and taught him everything I could. I hoped he could become a leader or a politician or something and realise, that there is maybe life beyond the island for the people.

*There wasn't, he didn't*

He would be inquisitive, very curious, he would ask question and I would offer answers without a second thought. In the end, he chose to be a scientist and philosopher.

He would study the ways of the world and the ways of the society. Eventually he reached a conclusion I hoped he wouldn't.

*Kill us all*

He figured out the secret to "godhood" and constructed a mask, which allowed him to siphon the power of gods. Without me noticing, he managed to steal the lives of several lower "gods" and with their power, he created a deadly virus, lethal to both gods and men.

With it, he set the island a blaze, destroying his people and taking the life of most of my friends and companions.

*The master and the apprentice*

I managed to find him, amidst the chaos. His vengeful eyes will haunt me to this day. I tried to reason with him, but it wouldn't do. There was nothing but destruction for this young one. There was also a greater intention behind, which I realized much later on, but in that moment, it was just me and him, colliding.

We fought for several days without an obvious conclusion, slowly, even the cinders died out. I didn't think much during that time. It was like a deadly dance and it felt like an activity you have been learning to do your entire life and so you don't even need to think about it.

*A duel of fates*

You know, crabby, there are many battles a man encounters in life. Many of them are against your adversaries, sometimes it's against your competitions. Other times, you are fighting your inner demons or you are in a slow and tedious dance with an intangible, yet monumental, authority. One that might seem like a higher power perhaps.

But you know, which fights are the worst? The ones where the opponent is someone you love, and there is no going back. Those ones hurt your body, your mind and your soul. And even if you win - did you really? Regardless of the outcome, you both lost.

*I killed him*

When the battle was over, the virus had already been eating away at my body and I wasn't nearly as powerful as I would later become. My flesh still mattered, I couldn't just turn into a gas, shake the virus and fuck off, back then.

*I thought I would die too*

I laid there, broken, staring at the sky just like I'm doing now. Only, right now, I can barely make out the surface, the one eye that sees well is out.

I was mistaken for a corpse and eventually, the others sealed off the island and cut it off of Earth, locking it in a different realm.

*I am like a cockroach*

I was in the dark for quite some time, but eventually, I could move some of my limbs again. It wasn't easy and it was painful. I managed to find some water and fix my worst wounds.

I would get re-infected by the virus several times in the following days.

*I found his mask, it's a reminder*

Over the course of many starless nights, I managed to regain my strength and escape, but I would just go back into the world and become a recluse for quite some time.

Most of those who were left had no idea I was alive.

*There goes my first funeral*

These things happen, Larry, and they take time. It's best not to dramatize things sometimes.

*Something bit my leg*

Lying in water like this is kinda relaxing, I get why all you fishy guys like being here. I am not sure if I could stay here forever though.

*Most likely I will*

But, it may be nice just to take in the moment. The waves go back and forth and sun goes up and down. It's a nice pattern. I always liked patterns. Many people do. Some say that humans are pattern-seeking animals.

*Perhaps*

There is comfort in patterns. You see things unfold and repeat and you know what comes next. Most things are in patterns. Sometimes you might not even realize it. You need some extremely long-term lens for that. In short term, the more grand patterns aren't often obvious to the naked eye.

*Did I ever break any of these patterns?*

I think it may be a time for another dream, before I go. Maybe two. Get ready, lil' crabby, and thanks for coming here. You are really interesting to talk to, you know that?

*A Forest*

I'm standing in a forest, Larry is inspecting rocks. He really seems to be quite an expert in all things geological so far.

Beyond the forest lies a village, I went through there, posing as a poor traveler. Come, Larry, let's do that again.

The village is not particularly rich or, let's say, sanitary, but I've seen worse. Some of the locals handle me with caution as is in place with unknown travelers, but an old couple invited me for dinner.

*Hospitality*

They took quite a liking to me, but I wasn't sure why, before they told me. Turns out, the look I had at the time had a uncanny resemblance to their deceased son.

*Shame*

I took a pity on them and stayed with them for some time. I would talk to them, I would let them take care of me. I didn't need it really, and I always made sure it wasn't too much.

It made them happy. And I was happy that they are happy. It felt like they were slowly recovering, my presence semed to grant them closure.

Eventually, it was time to leave. I figured my job was done. It was very late. It was dark already and one could barely make out the moon through the clouds. The land was silent spare for the occasional chirping of bugs and other sounds of nature.

*I told them I like to travel during the night. I do.*

Just as I was about to set off, the old lady grabbed my hand and looked into my eyes. She had tears running down her cheek.

You see, Larry, many people cry. It's normal to do so, it's relieving. But things matter when old people cry. As you go through life, your heart hardens. Not that old people are incapable of love, oh no, but it is harder to put a dent into an old man's heart.

You see, the end goal, I think, is not to live a such a life that everything is happy and nothing can touch you, it's to live such a life that you can withstand the tragedies of the world without becoming corrupt.

Old people like this, they have lived it. They encountered many such tragedies in their life. Now, they can withstand a lot, seeing them cry, that's powerful.

*Off tangent*

She asked me, if I was an angel. Oh, crabby, you wouldn't believe how much I wanted to say yes, but alas, I'm cursed. Not many people know it, but there is curse put on me, it's the price of my occupation. "He, who inherits hell may never utter a lie, lest he become a sinner himself" or something.

Yea, I think I might go off on a tangent once again. Let me introduce you to the idea of hell, Larry. There seems to be a lot of misconception and I won't be having a little crab like yourself going about your life without being properly informed.

It doesn't matter if you do some petty sins like all the religious texts say, it's your soul. You see, when I look at people, I see little flames in their chest.

*Maybe that's where the 'fiery hell' comes from?*

This flame tells me how corrupt a person is, or how big their hearts are. Sometimes, I see really kind people and they have nice and pure white and yellow flames. Some people have had their grip slip a little and there are some black spots in their flame.

When you are in love, it is a great burning hellfire, which outshines whatever impurities there may have been before. It's quite a sight to behold.

People who are in it like that, they can do everything. With such a blaze, you could carry the weight of the world and then some. I love seeing these.

*Sometimes, the flame is dead*

Unfortunately, there are those who have had their light snuffed out. There is not that many out there. These are the lost souls. No longer redeemable in their life.

*Those are the ones I take*

Only in Hell can they find themselves again. There is no flames in hell. It's actually a cold, damp and very gentle place. And what comes to you, is recollection. Visions and impacts of your deeds in life.

*Your only torturer is the weight of what you've done*

There, in this rehabilitation center, let's call it that, people aren't trapped forever. Eventually, one finds self-reflection and regret and acceptance. Their flame is reignited and they can leave.

*Off tangent part. 2*

I worked around this curse by showing my ice wings. They don't look like much, they are really big and I can't flap them, but they did the job, I think.

*I disappeared with a flash of light and a bang*

Whew, that was peculiar, wasn't it, crabby? Well, sometimes things are that way - I still haven't figured it out yet. It's after eons of watching mankind, that I realize that I can see what's going on in people and what they will do next and afterwards, but not really why it's like that.

Why were we cursed with feeling? Is it what makes us human? I ask myself that often, and yet, I would fight to death to protect feeling, and every day I yearn for it. After thousands of years of blindness I spent eons seeking to break the chains of apathy and discover emotion that was locked away from me. And for every lock I break and every emotion I discover, I find ten more lying in front of me.

*Will there ever be an end to this?*

*Is the final one at the top some truest love?*

The sea is getting colder, crabby. The sky is darker and the days are shorter. I appreciate you being here, it must have been a wild time for you, visiting another man's dreams and memories.

*Don't pinch my nose please*

I think that in winter, even the sea is quieter. Everything is affected by this time of year. Other seasons are not so impactful - what's a few colorful leaves against the contrast of a uniform white world and long dark nights?

*There is water flowing into my ribcage*

Well, this has been nice, crabby, but it appears, I may be done for. Welp, I wonder what happens now.

. . .

It's all fading to black, huh.

. . .

. . .

I am standing on the side of a flooded skyscraper. The surface is a long way up and the water is a bit green, but there is a lot of light surprisingly. There are almost no waves and the seabed isn't visible to the naked eye.


*Infinity*

A few meters in front of me stands the White One.

*Is it a soliloquy?*

"Howdy."

"Howdy."

"Long time no see."

"For you, for me it was barely a moment."

"Well that's what tends to happen when one is dead."

"You're the one to talk, you're dying."

"Well, yes? I am well aware. What do you want, anyway?"

"To bother you. You can think of it as payback."

"Hmm. Okay."

. . .

"Was it worth it?"

"Was what worth it?"

"Well, what you've done and how you ended up here."

"Oh, that. I guess."

"It was a stupid sacrifice. You wasted your life."

"You don't sacrifice, you can't know."

"Can't know what?"

"Better yet, a question. What is a man if he has a chance to save the life of another and does not take it?"

"Well, if there's harm to him then he is of sound mind."

"I do not want to be remembered as a coward, though."

"You get nothing from it though, and you lose a lot."

"Well, that's what sacrifice is. If you don't invest anything or if you expect something in return, then it's something else."

"But, she'll be a new person and without the 'crippleness', a nasty piece of work too. Your thousand-year search for fated love will have been a failure."

"Perhaps the search in and of itself was a failure in the first place. Love is complicated and I don't get it, but it seems that one has to look beyond the goal. I was blind and only chasing, I neglected to look at what comes after and what lies inside."

"So no fated love or love at first sight no more? Well that certainly sucks for some."

"I don't know, different people are different. Most of the times, love at first sight is a fool's errand. You see someone beautiful, you project onto them your fantasies and when the initial blindness disappears you are left with someone else. You either break up, or you start bringing misery into each others life."

"So it doesn't work, ha."

"Not necessarily. The misery thing, if it's between two good people, I think that it's just a way a person expresses how angry they are at themselves. Sometimes, you find a wolf in sheep's clothing and the misery is disproportionate. Sometimes, what you project isn't that far off and with minor hiccups, you can reach a satisfying conclusion."

"It's a lottery then and most of the times you lose, how fitting. Were you like this too, then? Blind and deluded?"

"Yes, I guess. Everyone was at some point. You see appearances, you see the outward personality and you feel like you can't live without this random person in your life. I no longer judge people by outside appearance. One has to get the pink out of their eyes and peer into the soul of another to start loving them."

"Oh, and how is this working out for you? Being out of the norm, that tends to work out all the time, doesn't it? Can this artificial conclusion defeat the nature of man?"

"It's not working out very well. With most people, before you get to peer into the abyss and decide whether you like it, you might miss your window and they won't be interested anymore."

"Was it like this for you with this one? She really wasn't the ideal beauty wasn't she. Nice face yes, but a decrepit cripple who looked sicker than the entire nation of Somalia."

"That's mean."

"No way, really? Perhaps I should definitely surely certainly watch what I say lest I offend someone. Oh wait, there is just you. Cunt."

"Hmm, nice. But yes, I took pity and I found her to be a great person, at first look. There was a humility, kindness and conscientiousness about her. I found it appealing."

"Well, that's strange, and how did it go? How was the ol' maggy and a blond space-cripple together?"

"It was fine until she started dying. The others were like vultures. 'The unique power to control the strings of space-time must be preserved' they said. In that world, I had to fight some I considered friends."

"Oh, well, looks like you are doing my job for me, quite well. Becoming a god-killer, are we?"

"It's just another weight I bear. Don't worry, when there will be enough weights, I'll just build a castle with a effective storage system."

"And that will help... how?"

"It won't but it will be pretty cool to do."

"Huh. What happened then? There are surely some events unaccounted for between you killing your friends and falling out of the sky and into the sea beaten up, impaled with spikes and decisively dying."

"Well you are in my head, you should already know that."

"I do, yeah, but I'm also a piece of shit and I'm hoping recounting the events would make you regret. Get you into the right dying mood, aye."

"Oh, well, alright, then. Have it your way."

"Damn right."

"Afterwards, I left the universe. I just recalled all the power I had available scattered across the world and tore a hole through everything, which led me out of the universe."

"Oh, interesting, what does it look like, outside the universe?"

"It felt like a hundred billion years going by every second. There is silence and endless white marble plane under an equally white sky. I think it's different for everyone."

"Huh, and that's where you got spiked through your stomach and some limbs? Or does the penetration come after the formal introduction?"

"Hmmm. There were a few big white marble guards, guarding what looked like a massive red-ish lens."

"You fought the guards."

"I did, they attacked me. I don't think I had any other choice anyway. It felt like there was no other way for me than forward."

"And that's when you got impaled."

"It is, yes, but I defeated them. I had so much power at my disposal and yet, those marble golems were very difficult to deal with"

"Alright, you fought them, got impaled, defeated them, yaddi-yaddi-yadda. What next?"

"Then I got an audience with the universe. That was the red lens. The entirety of the universe from an outside perspective. A huge living thinking being. Closest thing to an actual God, really. In comparison, we 'gods', are just pretenders."

"Why do you put 'gods' into air-quotes? That's who we are, you dipshit."

"We are just strange beings with a bunch of powers. We are just called 'gods' because we showed up at the right times in the right places. We just served as the supposed materialization of religious ideas, but we are just a weirder kind of man. That thing, that was eternity, and infinity. Incomparable."

"What sort of talk did you have, what sort of deal did you make?"

"Details are none of your business, you just need to know the consequences, and you already know them."

"Jeez, alright then, no need to be mean about it. Well, I guess that concludes it then. I shall savor your dying."

"I don't think so."

"You don't think so? Well you can't make me unsavor anything."

"About dying. I don't feel like dying."

"Well, tough luck, mate."

"Nah, I think I wanna see it through. And yes, luck is tough, I don't think I will be lucky enough to rest anytime soon."

"Cockroach."

"Well, touchÃ©. No, I wanna see this thing through, and I want to understand it better."

"What?"

"Love, goodness, the human condition. All that there is."

"Well, fuck you, you just can't undie yourself."

"Oh well, you might be forgetting something. Do you remember 'the man literally too angry to die'?"

"No, don't try it. Stop. Fuck off. Noo. Bitch. I will drag you down to he-"

*Wrath*

I regain my senses on the seabed. It's night, but that's not an issue. Larry's with me.

Good.

It's time to go on an adventure.

*I can move my remaining arm again*

You see, Larry, the trick to extraordinary performances is that just get pissed off and fucking do the thing. OH YEA! Now it's time to flip myself face down.

Bang, there we go. Larry, come, it's time to crawl wherever.

*My left eye is working again*

Ah, now I can see far again. It would have been better to get my eyes back to normal mode, but at least now I can see.

Yea, according to my estimation, it will take me 23 days to reach the closest shore at my current crawling speed. Also we might need to wait a while longer if I get close during the day, I don't want the locals seeing an aquatic zombie crawling out of the water. Wouldn't want to get my head bashed in.

*Hair is stuck in some plant-matter*

Ah, jeez, shit, no. If I am going to be a zombie, than it's with hair at least! If I went out without a scalp, I'd surely get shot if someone saw me. Let's break off those plants.

I will also have to take off all the corals and stuff that's growing all over me, but I think I will need to regenerate my other hand first, to do that. Well, it will take a few days, but no worries, can do.

Oh speaking of, how long have I been out, Jesus Christ. A year?! Really?! Well, thank you, Larry, that's like four years in crab years, I appreciate you. I'm gonny pay you back.

But right now, let me just keep slowly absorbing water until I can regenerate my body parts and then we will be good

*I regained some feeling in what's left of my legs*

Alrighty, come here, crabby, off we goooo!!

_/One more...  
Nevermore...  
Even unspoken answers  
Although sad  
Although lovable  
With just your warmth I forget everything.../_  

THE END
