This repository contains the source code of my website, contributions welcome.
To build it, you will need [morpho](https://github.com/luciusmagn/morpho).

### Building

```
morpho build
```

### Running

Locally for debugging purposes:
```
morpho serve
```

To run such website seriously, you need to point a webserver to the `public` folder.
