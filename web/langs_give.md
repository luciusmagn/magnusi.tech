# What Various Programming Languages Give You?
Every programming language has its pros and its cons, but they have
one thing in common: You need to give them your time, patience, mental
capacity, drive capacity and so on and so on. But what exactly do you
get in return? There are obvious things such as the ability to program,
fun, frustration, the programs. I'd like to, however, list some more
points for each of them. Since I want to stay positive in this one,
I won't include the languages I don't like. If someone wants to provide
unbiased good things for more languages, do so. I am not saying that
my finger won't slip from time to time, though.
